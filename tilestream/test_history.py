"""HISTORY OUTPUT: a streamed forecast must write the SAME wrfout frames.

Run it::

    python -m tilestream.test_history         # from the repository root

:mod:`tilestream.test_join` proves the streamed TRAJECTORY equals the resident
one, carrier by carrier, in the store.  :mod:`tilestream.test_io` proves that
ONE frame taken off that store equals the device frame, byte for byte.  Neither
of them proves that a RUN writes the right files, because neither of them runs
the loop that writes them -- and that loop is where this feature was broken.

WHAT WAS BROKEN, AND WHY IT LOOKED FINE
---------------------------------------
Three history call sites exist in ArWen and all three read the domain's
resident :class:`~gpuwm.core.state.DomainState`::

    gpuwm/runtime.py:2156,2263        write_case_output(prepared, ...)
                                      -> prepared.initial_result.state
    gpuwm/runtime.py:2702             _submit_tree_history_frame -> node.state
    gpuwm/prepared_single_domain_forecast.py:3999
                                      history_handler -> writers.submit(current)

A streamed domain's arrays do not live on that state.  ``streaming.attach``
copies the carriers into a pinned host store (``gather.pinned_copy``) and the
sweep writes the STORE; the resident state is never touched again.  So a
streamed run wrote the cold-start frame correctly and then wrote **the same
t = 0 field values into every subsequent frame**, with the correct Times
string, the correct global attributes and the correct variable inventory.  In
ncview that is a forecast in which nothing happens -- which is not obviously a
bug at 15 minute output over a quiet domain, and is not a bug at all if you
only ever open frame 1.  How much of a frame that freezes is MEASURED by
:func:`negative_frame_from_state` and printed per frame by the gate, rather
than asserted here.

The second defect is one level down and is the reason the first one could not
simply be papered over.  :meth:`tilestream.driver.TiledRun.sweep` documents
``step_kwargs`` as "forwarded verbatim to every tile's ``dycore.step`` ...
ArWen's own loop passes ``refl_10cm_due`` through it, and it has to reach
EVERY tile of a sweep" -- and the sweep called ``step(tiles[b], tile_cfg)``
with the kwargs dropped on the floor.  ``refl_10cm_due=True`` therefore never
reached a tile, no tile ever ran WRF's ``calc_refl10cm``, the ``refl_10cm``
scratch slot was never even allocated, and the consumer on the domain state
raised ``REFL_10CM output is due but no microphysics-time field is stashed``.
A streamed forecast could not publish reflectivity at all.

Fixing the drop is one line and immediately exposes the third defect, which
is the one the feature brief predicted: ``stash_refl_10cm`` refuses to
overwrite an unconsumed handoff, and a tile BUFFER serves several tiles per
sweep, so the second tile a buffer serves raises ``REFL_10CM stash was not
consumed before reuse``.  The handoff is per TILE and the frame is per DOMAIN;
the two have to be joined by the same scatter that joins everything else.

The fourth is the same mistake as the first, one field further on, and it is
about what a history write RESETS rather than what it reads.
``gpuwm.core.uh_diag.reset_up_heli_max`` zeroes the ``up_heli_max``
accumulator immediately after each frame is durable -- the WRF
history-interval reset, and a reset every publishing route already performs.
``up_heli_max`` is a SERIALIZED scratch slot, so it is a streaming CARRIER
and it is in the store; the reset was aimed at the resident state, hit
nothing, and left the running max growing across the whole run.  That is the
identical defect ``prepared_single_domain_forecast`` fixed once for the
resident path, with the note still in its ``history_handler``, re-introduced
by the mode and invisible because a monotone maximum is exactly what a
severe-weather diagnostic is supposed to look like.

WHAT IS UNDER TEST HERE
-----------------------
One configuration, integrated twice through
:func:`gpuwm.core.streaming.make_stepper` -- once resident, once streamed --
inside the same history loop, writing through the same
:class:`gpuwm.io.wrfout.AsyncDomainWrfoutWriter`, at the same cadence, to two
directories.  PASS is the strong form: **per-variable SHA-256 and whole-file
SHA-256 of every frame identical**, cold-start frame included.

Whole-file, not only per-variable, because the frame dict doubles as the
writer's schema and HDF5 lays its name heap out in variable-creation order:
:func:`tilestream.test_io.negative_field_order` measured a file 189 bytes
larger in which every variable compares equal.  A store-backed frame that
assembled the same numbers in a different order would pass a per-variable
comparison and hand a byte-different archive to everything downstream.

THE CONTROLS, AND WHAT EACH ONE CATCHES
----------------------------------------
``naive`` (frame from ``node.state``)
    The shipped behaviour, run on purpose.  MUST differ from frame 2 onward
    on every 3-D field except the base state (``PB``/``PHB``, which are
    input), and MUST agree on frame 1 -- both halves, because a control that
    differed at frame 1 too would be reporting a broken run rather than a
    frozen state.
``history-interval reset``
    Run the reset on the resident state only.  MUST make ``UP_HELI_MAX``
    differ from the second frame onward.
``refl dropped``
    Sweep with ``step_kwargs`` dropped again.  MUST raise the consumer's own
    "no microphysics-time field is stashed", not produce a zero field.
``refl from the last tile``
    Publish the tile buffer's own ``refl_10cm`` window instead of the
    scattered domain field -- the naive fix.  MUST differ, and it differs over
    3 of 4 tiles, which is what makes it a plausible-looking radar image.
``async, no drain``
    Submit frames to the background writer with ``overlap=False`` and let the
    solver sweep on WITHOUT waiting.  MUST differ: the carriers are zero-copy
    views of the pinned store and the sweep scatters into them mid-write.
    This is the one failure mode that is a race, so it is asserted as the
    PROPERTY that produces it (views change under a held frame) rather than
    timed.

CADENCE, PRINTED ON BOTH SIDES
-------------------------------
Three of this project's six false results were the same mistake: a number
measured in a window where radiation and cumulus never fired.  Every leg
reports ``state.physics.call_counts`` for radiation and cumulus and the
per-step ``refl_10cm_due`` schedule, and the two legs' counts are ASSERTED
equal.  At ``full fast cadence`` (radt 0.05 min, cudt 0.1 min, dt 30 s) both
fire on every step of the window; at ``mp10`` neither exists and the run is
reported as such rather than silently counted as coverage.

    * **silent** -- ``refl_10cm_due`` never reaches a tile, no tile calls
      ``calc_refl10cm``, and the domain's ``scratch/refl_10cm`` in the store
      is still EXACTLY ZERO after four due sweeps.  A frame written off that
      store is a complete, valid, correctly-timestamped wrfout with a radar
      field of 0 dBZ everywhere, and nothing anywhere reports a problem;
    * **loud** -- the model's own ``consume_refl_10cm`` then raises, at the
      history call site, which is the only symptom the defect ever produced
      and which points at the consumer rather than at the sweep.

    Asserting only the loud half would let a future "fix" that quietly
    supplies a stale or zero field pass.  MEASURED at mp10: the tile buffers
    DO own a ``refl_10cm`` slot (2 of 2 -- their warm-up step allocated it),
    the scatter faithfully assembles a domain field out of it every sweep,
    and that field is exactly zero everywhere (absmax 0.0) against a correct
    run that differs from it in 1,470,980 of 1,505,280 cells.  Zero dBZ over
    the whole domain in an otherwise complete, correctly-timestamped wrfout

    ``PerDomainWrfoutWriters.submit(node, ticks)`` is what ``gpuwm go``'s
