"""SPAWN-AT-TRIGGER UNDER STREAMING: does the trigger see the running domain?

``gpuwm.core.nest_spawn.SpawnWatch.evaluate`` decides WHEN a dormant nest is
born and WHERE it lands, from ONE whole-parent plane -- the parent's own
``uh_spawn_window`` (or its composite reflectivity) -- through an argmax and a
footprint-sized weighted centroid around the peak.  It reads that plane off
``parent_state``: the ``DomainState`` object the model tree holds
(``gpuwm/core/spawn_runner.py:200`` builds ``{grid_id: node.state}``).

That is exactly the object a STREAMED domain stops writing to.
``gpuwm.core.streaming.attach`` copies the prepared state's carriers into a
pinned host store and the sweep integrates the STORE; the ``DomainState``
survives only as an identity check (``StreamedDomain.__call__`` compares
``state is self._state`` and never touches its arrays).  A whole-domain
consumer that reads the state therefore reads the domain as it was at attach
time and not as it is now.

For the spawn trigger it is worse than stale, and this module measures the
difference, because the two failures need different fixes:

    STALE   the plane was written once and never again -- a consumer sees
            t=0 values and makes a t=0 decision.

    DEAD    the plane is not a streaming carrier AT ALL.  ``uh_spawn_window``
            and ``uh_follow_window`` are classified ``rebuild`` in
            ``gpuwm/io/restart.py:REBUILT_SCRATCH_SLOTS`` -- deliberately, and
            for a good reason that is about RESTART: a window means "max since
            that consumer last looked" and a checkpoint cannot know when the
            consumer will next look.  ``tilestream.physics_inventory
            .carrier_manifest`` builds the streaming inventory by CALLING
            restart's manifest builders, so a slot restart does not serialize
            is a slot streaming does not carry.  The domain-level window is
            never gathered, never scattered and never folded; each tile
            buffer folds into its OWN tile-shaped window and the next tile
            served by that buffer overwrites it.

    So the plane the spawn trigger reads on a streamed parent is the ZERO
    plane ``DomainState.__init__`` allocated (state.py:720), for the whole
    run.  ``np.max(plane) == 0.0`` for every threshold a user could
    configure, the watch records ``decision: no-signal`` at every leg
    boundary, and at ``latest_s`` it records ``window-closed`` with the note
    that says the reservation was held and the nest never fired -- which is a
    sentence about the WEATHER.  Nothing anywhere says the trigger was blind.

WHAT THIS MODULE RUNS
---------------------
The joined configuration of :mod:`tilestream.test_join` -- real Lambert
projection, real terrain, specified lateral boundaries, full physics -- with
``nwp_diagnostics = 1`` added, which is the switch the spawn trigger's field
depends on and which no lane in this project had ever turned on.  The same
domain is integrated twice, resident and streamed, and ONE
:class:`~gpuwm.core.nest_spawn.SpawnWatch` is evaluated against each result.
PASS is the fired grid_id, the fired flag and the chosen ``(i_parent_start,
j_parent_start)`` being IDENTICAL.

The threshold is not a guess.  It is taken from the RESIDENT run's own plane
at a high percentile, so it is crossed by a small, localized set of cells and
the argmax/centroid is a sharp decision rather than a domain-wide average --
and it is then applied unchanged to both sides.  A threshold that half the
domain crosses would place the nest at the domain centre on any plane at all,
including a plane of zeros, and would prove nothing.

THE CONTROLS
------------
``--no-fix``          the shipped behaviour: the tracker windows are not
                      streamed.  The streamed watch MUST fail to reproduce the
                      resident placement.  It ships as a required FAILURE, so
                      the gate fails if it ever starts passing -- that is the
                      only thing that says the positive is measuring anything.
``resident argmax``   printed, with the number of qualifying cells, so a
                      threshold that qualifies everything is visible.
``radiation/cumulus`` fire counts printed on BOTH sides of the comparison.
                      This project has produced three false results from a
                      timed window in which radiation and cumulus never fired.
``carrier census``    the store's carrier count and whether the window slots
                      are in it, printed before any comparison.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT TEST
------------------------------
The ``reflectivity`` trigger.  ``refl_10cm`` is a ``(nz, ny, nx)`` ephemeral
handoff produced only on an output-due microphysics call and consumed by the
writer (``gpuwm/core/refl.py``), classified ``rebuild`` on the DRIVER rather
than in the scratch pool.  It is dead under streaming for the same reason the
UH window is, but its fix is not the same fix -- it is an output-path
question, and ``tilestream/test_io.py`` owns the output path.
