"""The decision on the nowcast heating arm, from the score tables and the eye.

The rule is the one in Downloads/STORMSCOPE-HEATING-2026-10-06/
cases-and-scoring.md ("Decision rule"), with the arm letters of DESIGN.md:
A is the control, C the nowcast-heated arm, E the oracle.  C is promoted
only if every rule holds:

R1  By eye, on the MRMS | A | B | C | E | HRRR sheets, C places the new
    storms of f01 to f03 better than A in at least 3 of the 4 decision
    cases.  (A person judges; ``eye.json`` records it.  Without it the
    verdict is pending, never a pass.)
R2  Mean FSS at 35 dBZ in the 27 km box over f01 to f03 beats A in at
    least 3 of the 4 decision cases, and no decision case loses more than
    0.03.
R3  The 35 dBZ area ratio (model echo area over MRMS echo area) at each of
    f01 to f03 moves toward 1 or stays inside [0.5, 2], in every decision
    case.  Prevents: heating that wins FSS by painting too much echo.
    "Toward 1" is measured as |log(ratio)|, so 0.5 and 2 are equally far.
R4  Station T2 and Td2 RMSE at f01 to f06 no more than 0.05 K worse than A
    at any lead in any decision case.  Prevents: the right echo with
    spurious cold pools and outflow.
R5  At f12 and f18: FSS35 at 27 km no more than 0.03 below A, and T2 and
    Td2 RMSE no more than 0.05 K above A, in every decision case.
    Prevents: a short-range gain paid for with a long-range drift.
R6  The anchor case (case 5) is not worse than A on R2 to R4, read case by
    case: its f01-f03 mean FSS35 loses no more than 0.03, its area ratios
    pass R3, and its station RMSE passes R4.

E minus C (mean FSS35 at 27 km over f01 to f03) is reported per case as
the nowcast's cost.  The same rules are run on E against A; if E also
fails, the heating method is the problem, not the nowcast.

An arm whose heating read any oracle window can fill only an oracle column
(E, E3D); a table that puts one anywhere else is refused, because future
observations would be scored as forecast skill.
