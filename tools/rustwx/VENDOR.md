# Provenance of the vendored Rusty Weather renderer

## Source

Everything under `crates/` and `vendor/` (except `crates/rw-wrfbatch`
and `vendor/crates-io`, below) is Drew's own **rusty-weather**
workspace (MIT -- `LICENSE` in this directory is its license file),
vendored from the RW-Studio worktree at

    rust-weather-rwwps-studio @ commit 31b681e
    ("Preflight HRRR domains and isolate Python caches")
    PLUS its uncommitted working-tree state

The working-tree state is deliberate, not sloppy: the campaign's paired
CPU-vs-GPU product sheets were rendered by `rw_wrf_batch.exe` (sha256
`aa220a5a...`) built from exactly that tree, whose uncommitted diff is
the exact-time (sub-hourly) rendering support -- `RwsExactTime`
threaded through `StoreFieldSource`, `hour_presentation` valid/lead
stamps, and the removal of the blanket exact-time refusals from
`store_render::open` and `stored_run_hours`.

Vendored subset (the transitive closure `rw-wrfbatch` needs, nothing
more):

- `crates/`: rustwx-core, rustwx-io, rustwx-models, rustwx-products,
  rustwx-render, rustwx-contour, rustwx-calc, rw-store, rw-ingest,
  rusty-weather (library only)
- `vendor/`: grib-core, netcrust (with its vendored hdf5-reader),
  wx-core, wx-field, wx-math, wx-radar, metrust, ecape-rs
- `assets/basemap/`: Natural Earth 10m/110m (public domain) and US
  Census counties (public domain); `upstream-lock.json` is the source
  workspace's own provenance record
- Fonts: Source Sans 3 (OFL), embedded by rustwx-render
  (`crates/rustwx-render/assets/fonts/`, license alongside)

NOT vendored: the egui UI stack (rusty-weather-ui, rw-ui, rw-sim,
rw-sat, rw-glm, ...), rustwx-sounding/sharprs, the eleven rusty-weather
command-line bins and their 9.8 MB test fixtures.

## Deliberate divergences from the source tree

1. `crates/rusty-weather/Cargo.toml` is trimmed to the library target:
   the bins and their deps (clap, image, mimalloc, libmimalloc-sys,
   ecape-rs, rw-ingest, windows-sys) are dropped, as are the bin-only
   build.rs and `src/bin`, `src/main.rs`, `contour_mode.rs`,
   `domain.rs`, `region.rs`, `tests/`.
2. `crates/rw-wrfbatch` is new (not in the source workspace): main.rs
   is the Studio worktree's untracked
   `crates/rusty-weather-ui/src/bin/rw_wrf_batch.rs` adapted for gpuwm
   -- all stored frames render by default (`BatchHourScope::AllStored`
   instead of the minimum stored slot), `--frames N` selects the Nth
   stored frame (ordinal index, matching `gpuwm render --timeidx`), and
   the batch work limits are sized to the request instead of the GUI
   click ceilings.  The five modules beside it (grib_import,
   local_import, postproc_severe, wrf_process, wrf_volumes) are
   verbatim copies from rusty-weather-ui.
3. `crates/rusty-weather/src/render_all.rs::hour_presentation`: the
   exact-time subtitle drops zero seconds ("+003:30" not "+003:30:00")
   so the valid time survives the renderer's subtitle width limit.
4. `crates/rusty-weather/src/windowed_store.rs`: the stale test
   asserting `stored_run_hours` rejects exact-time axes (already
   contradicted by the source tree's own working-tree diff) is updated
   to the completed contract -- ordinal slots are listable, per-frame
   rendering proceeds, and fixed-hour WINDOWED accumulations alone
   remain refused on exact-time axes.
5. The workspace root `Cargo.toml` lists only the vendored subset.
6. Windowed products are axis-gated, not model-gated:
   `batch_render::inspect_renderable_products` and the "all"-keyword
   clear list/run the windowed lane for ANY model whose store has more
   than one whole-hour frame (`windowed_store::windowed_axis_ready`),
   with per-plane availability proven at compute time as ever.  The
   source tree gated the lane on `ModelId::Hrrr`.
7. `windowed_store::read_source_plane` accepts the wrfout import
   lane's names for physically identical planes: `apcp` (run-total
   APCP) behind `apcp_run_total`, `relative_humidity_2m` behind
   `rh_2m`, and `updraft_helicity_2to5km` (Registry units spelling
   `m2/s2`) as a third UH fallback.  Plane fidelity is tracked per
   source: the GRIB lane's `uh_2to5km` snapshot keeps its honest
   "lower bound" note, while `updraft_helicity_2to5km` (WRF
   UP_HELI_MAX, reset each history frame) is labeled what it is --
   the exact per-history-interval max, i.e. the exact trailing 1 h
   max at the hourly cadence the whole-hour windowed axis folds.
8. The wrfout import publishes per-level canonical selector planes:
   the sounding volumes' 200/250/300/500/700/850 hPa levels
   (height/temperature/dewpoint/u/v -- byte-identical to the volume
   levels), plus chart-level RH and absolute vorticity interpolated at
   those six levels only (same bracket/lerp walk, one extra native
   field resident at a time), plus the three cloudfrac planes under
   their canonical cloud-cover selectors.  This is what unlocks the
   isobaric chart recipe families on model output.
9. `wrf_process::wrf_product_slug` maps wrf-core's heavy ECAPE
   diagnostics onto the recipe slugs they are (same ecape-rs solver,
   parcel_type default "sb"): `ecape`->`sbecape`, `ncape`->`sbncape`,
   `ecape_cin`->`sbecin`, `ecape_ehi`->`ecape_ehi_0_1km`, and
   `ehi`->`ehi_0_1km` (SBCAPE x SRH1 / 160000, the catalog's sb
   proxy).  Deliberately NOT mapped: the lapse rates (wrf-core
   defaults to plain-T; the catalog's grids are virtual-temperature)
   and `lcl`/`lfc`/`el` (parcel identity unverified) -- they stay
   under `wrf_*` browse names.
10. `rw_wrfbatch --list-products` (new) enumerates the complete
    product catalog with per-store availability, and
    `direct/planning.rs::direct_recipe_requires_explicit_opt_in` is
    `pub` so the lister applies the exact planner filter.
11. Store-backed availability is model-identity-free end to end.
    `rustwx_models::plot_recipe_store_requirements` (new) enumerates a
    recipe's required fields/selectors without a `ModelId`;
    `direct/planning.rs::store_direct_recipe_slugs` (new) lists every
    non-opt-in direct candidate without the per-model fetch-plan
    filter.  `render_all::partition_products` (model parameter
    dropped), `batch_render::inspect_renderable_products`,
    `store_render::render_direct_recipes_from_store`, and
    `rw_wrfbatch --list-products` all decide from STORED FIELDS; the
    `gated` listing status and every "no fetch plan for model" reason
    are gone -- a non-renderable product always names its missing
    fields.  The per-model served-field tables in `rustwx-models`
    (e.g. `selector_supported_for_model`'s HRRR-only smoke and
    simulated-IR rows) remain for FETCH planning only: they state
    which operational source's downloadable files carry a field -- an
    input fact -- and no store-backed render or listing decision
    consults them.
12. The canonical catalog's windowed support rows are
    input-requirement gates: every non-QPF windowed entry derives its
    per-source support from `HrrrWindowedProduct::input_selectors`
    (new) instead of a hardcoded HRRR-only row, so sources serving the
    input fields (including the wrfout lane's `wrf` identity for 2-5
    km UH) list as supported and the rest are blocked with the missing
    input field named.  QPF windows keep curated lists (1-hour APCP
    bucket availability is a source fact an input selector cannot
    express).  The inventory fixture regenerates via
    `RW_UPDATE_PRODUCT_CATALOG_FIXTURE=1`.

## vendor/crates-io

`cargo vendor --locked vendor/crates-io` output: every crates.io and
git dependency in `Cargo.lock`, checked in so a clean clone builds with
`--offline` (source replacement in `.cargo/config.toml`).  The three
git dependencies (wrf-core from wrf-rust, ecape-rs, metrust-py) are all
FahrenheitResearch -- Drew's own -- repositories pinned to the exact
revisions the campaign renderer used; wrf-core rev `93bd2ca6` is the
same pure-Rust wrfout reader lineage as the pip `wrf-rust` package the
matplotlib engine uses.

Do not edit anything under `vendor/crates-io` -- each crate carries a
`.cargo-checksums.json` that cargo validates at build time.
