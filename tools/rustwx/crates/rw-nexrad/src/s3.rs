//! Anonymous AWS S3 access to the `noaa-nexrad-level2` open-data bucket

//!
//! This is the `rw-sat`/`rw-glm` `ListObjectsV2` pattern (paginated with
//! continuation tokens, query-encoded prefixes, XML unescaping, pure-Rust
//! rustls) retold for a bucket whose key space is a day directory per site
//! rather than an hour directory per product:

/// moving an entry OUT of the root and into a prolog or trailing comment,

/// anywhere in a `ListObjectsV2` response -- none of the captured real pages
/// carries one -- so the doctrine is now applied to the whole document
/// rather than to the half of it that had been probed.
///
/// Re-verification #6 found the two regions that doctrine had not reached,
/// and both are closed here rather than in the schema, because both are
/// statements about well-formedness that round 4 got wrong:
///
/// * an **attribute value** ([`xml_attributes`]) may not contain a raw
///   `<` -- XML 1.0 forbids it outright -- and a start tag may not declare
///   one attribute twice.  A real `<Contents>` moved into the root's
///   `xmlns` value was accepted with a short roster while `scan_xml` called
///   the document well-formed, which it was not (RV6-01);
/// * the **declaration's own body** ([`require_xml_declaration`]) is
///   `version`, then an optional `encoding`, then an optional `standalone`,
///   and nothing else.  Being allowed at byte zero is not being allowed to
///   contain anything (RV6-03).
///
/// Re-verification #8 measured two more places where the reader was reading
/// a language slightly wider than the one it claims, and one where it was
/// not reading at all:
///
/// * `<?>` is three bytes that made this function **panic**.  The terminator
///   was searched for from byte zero, so the `?>` starting at byte 1 was
///   found and the body slice ran backwards.  The search starts at byte 2
///   now and the sequence is what it looks like: a `<?...?>` region that
///   never terminates, or a processing instruction with an unreadable
///   target, refused by name either way (RV8-01);
/// * `S` is [`is_xml_space`], the four characters XML 1.0's production
///   names, wherever this function stands at an `S` position: what lies
///   outside the root, what ends a tag name, what ends a PI target, and
///   (in [`xml_attribute_pairs`]) what separates one attribute from the
///   last.  Unicode White_Space is wider, so NBSP and `#x2028` were
///   separators here and are not separators in XML (RV8-03);
/// * a literal `]]>` in character data is refused.  XML 1.0 §2.4 forbids it
///   outside a CDATA section, this reader has no CDATA sections, and the
///   legal spelling `]]&gt;` still decodes -- the check is on the source
