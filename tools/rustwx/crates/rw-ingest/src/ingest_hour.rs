//! Shared per-hour live-GRIB -> `.rws` ingest flow, used by `rw_ingest`
//! (serial hours), `rw_batch` (pipelined hours), and the UI shell's
//! ingest worker. Also the parent of the `ingest_profile` (what one run
//! fetches/extracts/computes/stores — the default `full` profile is the
//! behavior described below, unchanged) and `size_estimate` (exact +
//! predictive store/download sizing) child modules.
//!
//! Progress is reported through the [`IngestEvent`] sink on
//! [`IngestConfig`] (stage start/done walls plus the historical
//! stdout/stderr note lines — see [`crate::print_event`]); cancellation is
//! observed at stage boundaries via the config's cancel flag and surfaces
//! as [`IngestError::Cancelled`]. The store write is atomic (temp + rename
//! inside rw-store), so a cancel mid-hour never leaves partial files — at
//! worst the in-flight stage finishes and the hour is dropped before its
//! write.
//!
//! Per forecast hour: fetch the `prs` product file (cache-aware), extract
//! the full 3D isobaric superset plus the sparse per-level vorticity planes
//! AND every isobaric plane a supported direct plot recipe consumes (stored
//! as bit-exact 2D variables named by selector key — the 3D volume codec is
//! quantized, so render-grade isobaric planes must ride the lossless f32
//! 2D codec) in ONE decode pass, fetch the `sfc` product file, extract the
//! 2D surface set in ONE decode pass (plus one re-select at `hour - 1` for
//! the trailing 1 h window fields: the APCP increment, the native
//! sub-hourly MXUPHL max, and the native sub-hourly WIND 10 m max — the two
//! max fields the GRIB windowed lane consumed), then ENCODE the extracted
//! 2D planes and volumes into the spill-backed
//! [`rw_store::ingest::HourIngestWriter`] immediately (freeing the raw f32
//! planes; volumes ride deferred variable ids so the file keeps the
//! historical fields/derived/heavy/volumes order), decode the surface +
//! pressure thermo pair through the render lanes' own products decoder,
//! compute every non-heavy derived recipe grid AND (when `heavy` is set)
//! every heavy ECAPE-class recipe grid from that pair (see `ingest_compute`;
//! stored as ordinary 2D variables named by recipe slug, selector = the
//! `{"derived": ...}` marker), and finish the hour into
//! `<store-root>/<model>/<run>/f{hour:03}.rws` plus `grid.rwg` and
//! `run.json`. Output bytes are identical to the historical
//! assemble-everything-then-write flow; only the peak memory changed.
//!
//! The flow is split at the network/CPU boundary — [`fetch_hour`] (network
//! or cache disk read only) and [`process_fetched_hour`] (extract, derived,
//! heavy, encode — all CPU on the ONE global rayon pool) — so `rw_batch`
//! can run hour N's compute while hour N+1 downloads. [`ingest_hour`]
//! composes the two for serial callers.
//!
//! No `nat` (wrfnat) fetch: every formerly "native-only" 2D field this plan
//! needs (composite reflectivity, 1 km AGL reflectivity, 2-5 km updraft
//! helicity, 8 m AGL smoke, column-integrated smoke, simulated IR) is also
//! carried by the HRRR `sfc` file — verified against the live
//! `hrrr.t00z.wrfsfcf06.grib2.idx` listing on AWS for the 2026-06-08 00z run
//! — so they ride the existing sfc fetch + decode pass for free instead of
//! pulling any of the ~770 MB wrfnat file.
