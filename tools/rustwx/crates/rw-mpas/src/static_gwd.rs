//! Sub-grid orography statistics -- `var2d`, `con`, `oa1..4`, `ol1..4` -- on
//! the bounded, admission-gated geography reader.
//!
//! A transcription of `mpas_init_atm_gwd.F` (`compute_gwd_fields` and the
//! `get_*` statistic functions), not a reinterpretation of it. Every formula
//! below is the one MPAS evaluates, including the integer-division box halving
//! that decides which pixels count as "upstream", because the gravity-wave
//! drag scheme downstream was tuned against these exact definitions.
//!
//! These statistics are NOT cell averages. MPAS cuts a rectangular lat/lon box
//! of the 30-arc-second topography centred on each cell, sized from the cell's
//! mean `dcEdge`, and reduces that box. A Voronoi-cell average would be a
//! different quantity wearing the same name, so the box is reproduced exactly.
//!
//! # Three places this is deliberately NOT the Fortran, each named
//!
//! **The water category is read, not hardcoded.** MPAS hardcodes `WATER = 16`,
//! the USGS land-use code, when splitting land from water inside `get_con`.
//! That constant is wrong for any MODIS dataset, where 16 is barren land and 17
//! is water -- pointed at MODIS tiles unchanged it calls every desert an ocean.
//! This reads the water code from the dataset's own index. Where the dataset IS
//! USGS the two agree exactly; where it is not, this is right and MPAS is
//! wrong. Recorded in the receipt as `water_category_source`.
//!
//! **The source frame is read, not assumed.** MPAS holds one global array and
//! knows, by construction, that its column 1 is 180 W. A WPS_GEOG archive
//! declares its own origin, and the archives do not agree with each other:
//! measured on the staged tree, `topo_gmted2010_30s` declares
//! `known_lon=0.004166667` while `modis_landuse_20class_30s_with_lakes`
//! declares `known_lon=-179.99583`. Taking either as "column 1 is 180 W" puts
//! one of the two exactly half a globe from every cell -- terrain sampled from
//! the antipode, silently, with every value finite and plausible. Every index
//! here is derived from the dataset's own `index`, and the offset between the
//! two datasets is computed rather than assumed. See [`FrameAlignment`].
//!
//! **A cell's box never falls off the band.** The Fortran holds the whole
//! array, so a box that reflects across a pole reads real rows. A band reader
//! that widened only to the unreflected span would hand those pixels zero, and
//! WHICH pixels depends on how cells happened to group into bands -- which
//! would make the answer a function of the memory budget. Bands here are
//! widened to the reflected span, so every cell reads the same numbers at
//! every budget and every worker count. That is what [`compute`] means when it
//! promises determinism.
