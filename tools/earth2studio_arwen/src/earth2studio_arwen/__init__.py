"""ArWen (CUDA WRF-ARW) and hex (CUDA MPAS-A) for NVIDIA Earth2Studio.

- ``WoofHistory``: a gpuwm / gpuwm-hex run's history as an Earth2Studio
  ``DataSource`` (read through gpuwm's Earth-2 exporter).
- ``ArWen``: ArWen as an Earth2Studio ``PrognosticModel`` (one gpuwm run per
  step, boundaries from any Earth2Studio data source).

Earth2Studio has no plugin registry: its extension points are the
``DataSource`` and ``PrognosticModel`` protocols, and any object that
satisfies them goes straight into ``earth2studio.run.deterministic``,
``diagnostic`` and ``ensemble``. Both classes here satisfy them
(``isinstance(x, DataSource)`` / ``isinstance(m, PrognosticModel)``).
