# earth2studio-arwen

ArWen (a CUDA port of WRF-ARW, package `gpuwm`) and hex (a CUDA port of
MPAS-Atmosphere, package `gpuwm-hex`) for [NVIDIA Earth2Studio](https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio).

- **`WoofHistory`** is an Earth2Studio data source over a gpuwm or gpuwm-hex
  run. It reads the run's history through gpuwm's Earth-2 exporter
  (`gpuwm export --earth2`) in Earth2Studio's own variable names
  (`u10m`, `t2m`, `msl`, `z500`, `q850`, ...) on the 0.25 degree lattice
  Earth2Studio's global models use, so any Earth2Studio diagnostic,
  downscaler or tracker can run on a physics forecast.
- **`ArWen`** is an Earth2Studio prognostic model. Each step runs one ArWen
  forecast over a latitude-longitude box, started from the state Earth2Studio
  hands it, with lateral boundaries from any Earth2Studio data source, and
  returns ArWen's state in the same variables one boundary interval later.

Earth2Studio has no plugin registry; its extension points are the
`DataSource` and `PrognosticModel` protocols. Both classes satisfy them
(`isinstance(src, DataSource)`, `isinstance(model, PrognosticModel)`) and go
straight into `earth2studio.run.deterministic`, `diagnostic` and `ensemble`.

## Install

Earth2Studio and gpuwm usually live in separate environments (each brings its
own CUDA stack). Install this package beside Earth2Studio and tell it where
gpuwm is:

```sh
pip install earth2studio-arwen            # in the Earth2Studio environment
export GPUWM_PYTHON=/path/to/gpuwm-env/bin/python   # where `pip install gpuwm[all-cu13]` ran
export GPUWM_CASE_DATA_ROOT=/path/to/case-data      # gpuwm's static geography (WPS_GEOG) lives here
```

## A WOOF run as an Earth2Studio data source

```python
import earth2studio.run as run
from collections import OrderedDict
from earth2studio.io import NetCDF4Backend
from earth2studio.models.dx import WindgustAFNO
from earth2studio.models.px import Persistence
from earth2studio_arwen import WoofHistory

src = WoofHistory("hex-run/forecast", consumers="windgust-afno")   # channels WindgustAFNO needs
dx = WindgustAFNO.load_model(WindgustAFNO.load_default_package())
ic = dx.input_coords()
px = Persistence(list(ic["variable"]), OrderedDict(lat=ic["lat"], lon=ic["lon"]))
times = ["2026-10-17T00", "2026-10-17T06", "2026-10-17T12", "2026-10-17T18"]
run.diagnostic(times, 0, px, dx, src, NetCDF4Backend("gust.nc"))
```

`consumers` names rows of gpuwm's Earth-2 table (`windgust-afno`,
`precip-afno`, `climatenet`, `tc-tracker`, `stormcast-conus`); `channels` adds
any other Earth2Studio variable id. The export runs once per run folder and
is cached beside it.

## ArWen as an Earth2Studio prognostic model

```python
import earth2studio.run as run
from earth2studio.data import ARCO
from earth2studio.io import NetCDF4Backend
from earth2studio_arwen import ArWen

model = ArWen((30, -105, 44, -89), boundary=ARCO(), dx_km=3.0, margin_deg=2.0)
run.deterministic(["2024-05-21T12"], 1, model, ARCO(), NetCDF4Backend("arwen.nc"))
```

The state is z, t, u, v, q on 13 pressure levels plus t2m, u10m, v10m and
msl (the variables gpuwm's `earth2-pl13-q-netcdf-v1` profile reads), on the
0.25 degree points of the box. gpuwm fits an ArWen domain inside the box,
takes the land surface from the ERA5 analysis at the initialization (keyless),
and runs the forecast on the GPU. Inside the domain the output is ArWen's
forecast; the ring between the domain and the box edge is the boundary
source's state at the output time. A run whose inputs are byte-identical to a
finished one is reused.

## Licence

Apache-2.0. Earth2Studio and gpuwm are Apache-2.0; this package calls them
through their public interfaces and copies no code from either. Model weights
an Earth2Studio model downloads carry their own licences.
