"""Regenerate the resolved-scale disclaimer change receipt.

Two receipts come out of this tool, and the split is deliberate:

``docs/public/receipts/resolved-scale-disclaimer.json``
    everything a public-repo holder can reproduce -- the baseline and
    post-edit greps, the normalized-item substring measurements, the
    negation-invariant verdict with its three mutant verdicts, the
    added-lines-only case-identity scan, the Markdown structure and width
    measurements, and the cross-reference check.

``docs/superpowers/receipts/perf-gate-sentence.json``
    the internal half: the performance-gate sentence added to the private
    design spec, its substring measurements, and the two-sided proof that
    the subtree it lives in is release-excluded.  It is written under a
    release-excluded path because that is what it describes.

Every field is measured here and none is authored: verdicts are computed
from the same production paths a verifier would run by hand, and the tool
records what it finds.  Mutants are built in a temporary directory and
deleted; only their verdicts are recorded.

Two kinds of field, and they answer to different things
-------------------------------------------------------
*Live-tree* fields -- the negation verdict and its occurrences, the item
finds, the gate block, the post-edit greps -- describe the tree as it
stands.  They must be re-measured whenever the tree moves, which is what
keeps the receipt from ageing into a snapshot of a claim.

*Diff* fields -- the case-identity scan, the Markdown structure counts,
the CHANGELOG entry, the untouched-announcement proof -- measure one
change.  They are scoped by ``--base``, and, once this branch has been
merged into a tree that other work also landed in, ``git diff <base>``
no longer names that change: it names everything since.  ``--edit-tip``
pins the other end, so the diff fields keep measuring the edit the
receipt is about while the live-tree fields re-anchor to the assembled
tree.  Without it the tool behaves exactly as before -- base against the
working tree.

Usage::
