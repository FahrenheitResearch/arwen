"""Stage an ArWen frame dump as a wrfout-convention file for the t=0 digest.

``tools/matched_wrfout_t0_state_digest.py`` scores a candidate/reference
pair of wrfout-convention netCDF frames.  The matched-trajectory lane's
frame writer (``run_arwen.py``) dumps ``.npz`` archives whose keys are
already WRF variable names on WRF's own staggering, so the only thing
standing between those dumps and the registered full-state digest is the
container format.  This tool re-containers one frame, exactly:

* every staged array is written float32, byte-for-byte the ``.npz`` value --
  no cast, no transpose, no fill handling, nothing derived;
* the SHA-256 of the source archive is embedded in the output's global
  attributes, so the staged file names the raw artifact it came from and a
  reader can tie it back to a committed hash manifest;
* any field excluded from staging is named in the global attributes with
  the caller's reason.  An exclusion the file itself does not disclose
  would be curation; this one is part of the record.

The one expected exclusion is ``RAINNC``.  An ArWen run restarted from a
mature WRF history frame begins with a fresh accumulator (zero) while the
frame carries the storm's accumulated rain to that hour; both gate
documents pre-declare that comparison as two different quantities
(mp28-shortwindow-gate.md section 3, "published, never gated").  Staging it
into a state-identity digest would score that design decision, not the
state read-back.  Re-run this tool without ``--exclude`` to stage it
anyway; the digest will then report exactly that accumulator difference.

Usage:
    python stage_frame_for_t0_digest.py --frame FRAME.npz --out OUTFILE \\
        [--exclude FIELD=reason ...]

The output filename should follow the wrfout convention
(``wrfout_d<NN>_<time>``) so the digest's frame discovery pairs it; on
filesystems that forbid ``:`` in names the digest accepts ``_`` in the
timestamp.
