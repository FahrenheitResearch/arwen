"""Rewrite physics_registry_v2.json from the verified knob tables.

Importing this module is side-effect free: nothing is read and nothing is
written until :func:`main` runs.  It used to write the registry at module
scope, so any ``import tools.build_registry`` -- a test collecting the tools
tree, a REPL, an editor's autocomplete -- silently rewrote a tracked file.

``tests/test_build_registry.py`` is the enforcement this file lacked: it runs
the builder into a temporary path and requires the bytes to equal the tracked
registry.  Without that gate the builder and the file it generates drift, and
they did: replaying the pre-fix builder reverted every citation commit 611396b
had just corrected.
