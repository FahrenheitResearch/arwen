"""Where a rendered product PNG goes -- the one answer, for both engines.

Every picture a run drew used to land in ONE directory.  A three-nest
run of the rust catalog at hourly output puts five figures of files
there, of every product and every valid time, and the only way to find
one is to read filenames::

    out/case/png/arwen_wrf_20260520_18z_f000_d02-3km_composite_reflectivity.png
    out/case/png/arwen_wrf_20260520_18z_f000_d02-3km_2m_temperature.png
    out/case/png/arwen_wrf_20260520_18z_f000_d04-100m_composite_reflectivity.png
    ... 10,869 more

The layout below replaces that.  It is ArWen's 2026-08-06 ruling -- case
folder, then domain, then product subfolders, organised AT RENDER TIME
rather than tidied afterwards -- with the reporter's timestamp request
slotted into it as the leaf grouping::

    <--out>/<domain-token>/<product>/<valid-day>/<filename>.png

Read as a sentence: *which nest, which chart, which day.*  The case
folder is ``--out`` itself, which every front door already sets per
case (``gpuwm go`` gives it ``<case>/png``), so this module never
invents a case name -- it could not, and a case name in generic code is
a rule this project has paid for twice.

A nest that RETIRES and RE-ARMS lives more than once, and its lives are
separated one segment deeper::

    <--out>/<domain-token>/<episode>/<product>/<valid-day>/<file>.png

*which nest, which life, which chart, which day.*  The order above is
untouched -- domain still before product still before valid day -- and
the episode sits under the domain it is an episode OF, which is where
``gpuwm.io.wrfout`` already files that nest's history
(``d05/episode-002/``).  Without it, two episodes of one nest at one
valid time -- the retiring episode's last frame and the re-armed
episode's ACTIVATION frame, which the history writer's own duplicate
guard exists to keep apart -- render to one delivered name, and the
second replaces the first with no failure and no warning.  A domain
that declares no ``retire``/``rearm`` has one life, reports episode
``0``, and files at exactly the three segments it always did.

Four properties are the contract, and each is pinned by a test in
``tests/test_render_layout.py``:

**It is the default.**  Not a flag, not an opt-in.  ``--layout flat``
exists only so a consumer written against the old directory has
somewhere to stand while it is updated, and it reproduces the v2.4.1
spelling byte for byte.  A correctness remedy that ships off is a
workaround; this one ships on.

**It is predictable.**  The path is a pure function of the three facts
in it, so a script can compute where a frame will be BEFORE it exists
and watch that one file, instead of globbing a directory and diffing
listings.  There is no adaptive bucketing, no "split when it gets big":
those cannot be predicted, which defeats the point.

**It never loses a file.**  Every segment has a defined value even when
the fact behind it cannot be read: an unidentifiable domain is
``native_grid`` (the spelling both engines already use), an unreadable
valid time is :data:`UNDATED`, an unparseable engine filename is
:data:`UNCLASSIFIED`.  A picture is always somewhere nameable, never
dropped and never left loose at the root.  Path LENGTH is part of that
promise on Windows, and it is answered TWICE.

:func:`delivered_name` answers the half that is ours: a frame filed
under ``<domain>/<product>/`` used to carry those same two tokens inside
its own filename, and a delivery measured on disk reached 310 characters
because of it.  The pair comes off at the organisation step -- the same
layout is then 226 characters under a typical case root -- and
:func:`engine_name` puts it back, so nothing is lost and no two frames
in a folder collapse onto one name.

:func:`fs_path` answers the half that is the caller's: a case root deep
enough still passes ``MAX_PATH``, the move into the tree fails, and the
picture is left flat at the root -- the ruling inverted for exactly the
products whose names are longest, while their shorter neighbours file
correctly and the directory looks almost right.

**One walker reads it.**  :func:`iter_rendered` is what every in-tree
consumer of a render directory uses, so a reader cannot be written that
sees only half the tree -- and it skips dot-directories, because the
early render's scratch is a dot-prefixed sibling of the pictures and a
naive recursive read would publish a half-finished run's temporaries.

The day is the day the frame is VALID, not the day its run was
initialised: a 21z cycle at f+06 files under the next morning, which is
the date a forecaster is looking for.

#: :func:`delivered_name`.
#:
#: ``model`` is non-greedy so the first eight-digit run is the date.
#:
#: The cycle hour is ONE OR TWO digits, and the one-digit form is not a

#:
#: The LEAD is THREE OR MORE digits, for the same reason the episode
