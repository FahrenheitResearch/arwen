"""The lateral boundary after an analysis replaces the start state (WRFDA's da_update_bc).

real.exe's first ``wrfbdy_d01`` record is always the coupling of its own wrfinput
(main/real_em.F:866-899), and the WRF-input door refuses a pair whose first record is another
atmosphere (:func:`gpuwm.ingest.wrfinput._check_initial_boundary_pair`: a boundary from another
real.exe run silently forcing this initial state).  An analysis is exactly such a start: the
background's boundary, forcing the analysed state.  Left as it is, the specified zone snaps the
rim to the background at the first step and the relaxation zone pulls the analysed columns back
toward it through the whole first interval.

WRF's rule after an analysis replaces the start is WRFDA's ``da_update_bc``, which operational
HRRR runs after GSI: the first record becomes the analysis's own coupling and its tendency is
re-derived so the END of the first interval stays the boundary's own,
``BT' = (B + BT*dt - B') / dt``.  :func:`rebase_first_record` writes that file: the first
record's values from :func:`gpuwm.ingest.wrfinput.wrf_initial_boundary_head` (the one
definition the door checks a pair against, and the stock-WRF exporter writes from) applied to
the start file, the tendencies re-derived in float64, every later record and every other byte
the original's.  The same rule the stock exporter applies to a replaced start
(:func:`gpuwm.wrf_direct._wrfbdy_fields`).

A cold start inside the first boundary interval (an analysis valid between boundary records,
WRF analysis door gap G8b) is rebased the same way, onto the instant the start is valid: the
first record is restamped to the start, its values are the start's own coupling, and its
tendency is re-derived so the end of the interval is still the boundary's own,
``BT' = (B + BT*T - B') / (T - (t - t0))``.  The record then covers ``[t, t0 + T)``, a lead
interval shorter than the cadence, which the WRF-input door reads as such
(:func:`gpuwm.ingest.wrfinput.wrfbdy_coverage`); every later record and every other byte is the
original's.  WRF's own evaluation of the record at ``t`` (``B + dtbc*BT`` from a record left at
``t0``) gives the same coupled value, but ArWen's default boundary path re-normalises each
interval's END POINTS by the column mass at that instant and interpolates between them, so a
record left at ``t0`` with back-extrapolated values would put the rim at ``t`` somewhere other
than the start's own coupling; the restamped record has both ends at real states.  A start in a
later interval is cropped to the record that holds it first (records before it never force the
run).  The cycling-restart route reads the boundary at its own instant and the door does not
rewrite it there.
