"""Results and compatibility that move between releases, said once.

A release that corrects a transcription against WRF changes the numbers
an existing configuration produces, and it is default-on because a fix
ships default-on.  The reader who upgrades needs to be told WHICH of
their configurations move and by how much, on the two surfaces they
actually read: the CHANGELOG's release section and ``gpuwm doctor``'s
upgrade note.  Those two surfaces used to be written independently, and
the 2.7.0 candidate showed the failure mode: seventeen default-on
changes were in neither.

So the table lives here, once, and both surfaces are built from it:

* ``CHANGELOG.md`` carries every entry verbatim under the release's
  ``### Results that move from <previous>`` and ``### Restart and import
  compatibility`` headings.  ``tests/test_upgrade_notes.py`` asserts
  that the file contains every entry, so a bullet cannot be edited in
  one place and not the other.
* :mod:`gpuwm.whats_changed` appends the same entries to the release's
  upgrade note, which :func:`gpuwm.doctor.upgrade_note` prints once
  after an upgrade and ``gpuwm doctor --since VERSION`` prints on
  demand.

Every entry names the configuration it touches (``km_opt``,
``mp_physics``, ``cu_physics``, ``sf_sfclay_physics``, a ``[tiles]``
key) so a reader can tell in one pass whether their run is affected.
Plain sentences, no dashes as punctuation: the same lines are printed
on a terminal and pasted into release posts.

        "Dry mixing tendencies carry WRF's rk_addtend_dry map-factor "
        "division (1/msf) on mapped grids with km_opt = 2, 3 or 4. Every "
        "shipped real-data configuration selects km_opt = 4, so the u, v, w "
        "and theta mixing rows move by the local map factor and 2.6.5 "
        "mapped-grid bitwise baselines no longer reproduce.",

        "Real-data initialization loads the hydrostatic pressure recurrence "
        "with total water (vapour plus every analyzed condensate species), as "
        "module_initialize_real.F does. The initial pressure moves wherever "
        "the forcing carries hydrometeors: native HRRR, wrfinput, met_em and "
        "any analyzed_species route. Measured worst move 4.34 Pa on the "
        "native HRRR case.",

        "The MM5 surface layer (sf_sfclay_physics = 1 or 91) publishes USTM "
        "unconditionally, so the km_opt = 2 TKE surface drag with a PBL "
        "scheme on reads the real u* instead of zero. That configuration's "
        "TKE budget and mixing coefficients change at first order.",

        "Kain-Fritsch (cu_physics = 1) shallow feedback tendencies divide by "
        "the unrounded 2400 s TIMEC that module_cu_kfeta.F re-sets before "
        "its feedback loop. Whenever dt does not divide 2400 s all six "
        "shallow tendencies move; at dt = 90 s they were 1.23 percent low.",

        "NSSL two-moment (mp_physics = 18): the Bigg rain-freezing graupel "
        "gate is 1e-12 kg/kg (WRF's live override of 1e-7), the fused "
        "ice-nucleation vertical velocity is WRF's single interface average "
        "0.5 (w[k] + w[k+1]), and the low-temperature cnuc term reads the "
        "raw staggered w. Transfers move in the 1e-12 to 1e-7 window and "
        "primary ice nucleation moves wherever w has vertical shear.",

        "Morrison (mp_physics = 10) rebuilds the PGAM reference density from "
        "the current temperature, pres / (287.15 T), instead of the density "

        "moves with it.",

        "correctly rounded float32 implementation; the glibc-derived one is "
        "removed. On the 216-column capture RAINCV and PRATEC move by at "
        "most 7.3 percent, median 1.6 percent.",

        "P3 (mp_physics = 50) spells three integer exponents as "
        "multiplications, as gfortran compiles them, instead of routing "
        "them through powf; results move at the last-bit level.",

        "MYNN surface layer (sf_sfclay_physics = 5): the stable psih table's "
        "1/1.1 exponent is folded in float32 as gfortran folds it, which "
        "moves 268 of the 1001 table words by up to 3 ULP; the table's "
        "pinned SHA-256 changed.",

        "Every non-root domain owns its acoustic carrier ww_pp instead of "
        "sharing a view of the root's, so a child no longer overwrites its "
        "parent's held boundary flux. Multi-domain results change, and "
        "resident GPU memory grows by one (nz+1, ny, nx) float32 field per "
        "non-root domain; a tree that just fitted a card in 2.6.5 can now be "

        "ERA5 preparation fetches the lake-model mixed-layer temperature and "
        "uses it for lake cells with ice-free lake state, replacing the skin "
        "temperature fallback, so lake surface temperatures move on every "
        "fresh ERA5 case with lakes. A lake cell whose source lake state is "
        "frozen, partially frozen or missing retains the existing "
        "analysed-water or skin-temperature fallback. The preparation "
        "receipt reports the affected cells, including wholly frozen lakes. "
        "A 2.6.5 ERA5 GRIB cache without the lake messages keeps its fallback.",

        "Prepared HRRR initialization plans a soil-texture mesh on the "
        "projected source grid, so soil moisture and deep soil temperature "
        "are downscaled onto domains finer than the 3 km source. A 3 km "
        "domain from HRRR is unchanged; a 1 km domain moves.",

        "(num_soil_layers, resolved per land-surface scheme) instead of the "
        "nine-layer default; six-layer RUC children used to fail forecast "

        "GMT, JULYR, JULDAY and the twelve *_PATCH_* extents), and "
        "SIMULATION_START_DATE on a delayed-start nest is the run's origin "
        "rather than the domain's own start, so lead times read from that "
        "attribute agree across domains.",
