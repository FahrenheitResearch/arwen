"""WRF namelist importer: namelist.wps + namelist.input -> experiment TOML.

Phase-5 Task 1 (recon G10, panel lane L1).  ``import_namelists`` reads both
WRF namelists into the typed experiment schema (gpuwm/experiment.py),
converts WRF's STAGGERED ``e_we``/``e_sn``/``e_vert`` to gpuwm mass
dimensions explicitly (one fewer point: the bundle's 251 x 201 x 50
namelist domain is gpuwm's 250 x 200 x 49), maps only implemented physics
schemes, and emits the resolved TOML text plus a structured
:class:`SubstitutionReport` -- NEVER silent: every namelist key is either
translated, recorded as a ratified substitution (mp 55 -> 10 Morrison,
RRTMG -> RTE+RRTMGP; bl_pbl 11 imports natively since the Shin-Hong
port), recorded as consumed-without-counterpart, or a hard error.

Child ``dx``/``dy`` namelist entries (the bundle hand-types
``333.333333`` for d04) are cross-checked against the exact parent-chain
rational and then DROPPED from the output: the resolved TOML never
hand-types child dx/dt -- gpuwm/experiment.py derives them exactly
(dx 12000 -> 3000 -> 1000 -> 1000/3 m; dt 60 -> 15 -> 5 -> 5/3 s for the
bundle's 1,4,3,3 ratios).  The namelist chain is authoritative; the
"500 m d04" prose value is a pinned hard error, not a rounding choice.

Omitted namelist keys resolve to their WRF v4.6.1 Registry defaults
(review F2), so an implicitly two-way namelist (omitted ``feedback`` =>
Registry default 1) enables the plainly labelled experimental feedback
path instead of silently importing as one-way; ``km_opt`` (Registry default -1 =
must-set) is a hard error when omitted.  Values gpuwm supplies WITHOUT a
Registry source (the ``ztop`` scaffold; ``time_step_sound`` auto -> 4)
are recorded as :class:`AppliedDefault` entries.  Registry defaults that
bind for the reference run and differ from gpuwm's frozen RunConfig
defaults are emitted explicitly (Phase-4 ratified native-dt baseline):
``emdiv = 0.01``, ``hypsometric_opt = 2``, ``h_sca_adv_order = 5``.

Knob-parity contract (product/knobs lane): every namelist key the model
GENUINELY HONORS maps to its experiment-TOML counterpart, and the
report classifies every consumed key into exactly one of three explicit
sections -- TRANSLATED (a TOML value came out of it, including the
ratified substitutions), FIXED BY ARWEN (the key was validated against
the single implemented value and recorded with that value and why), or
NOT IMPLEMENTED (consumed without a counterpart, each with a reason).
RunConfig-honored keys the importer previously refused as unmapped now
translate: the per-domain turbulence row ``c_s``, ``c_k``,
``mix_isotropic``, ``mix_upper_bound``, ``tke_upper_bound``,
``tke_heat_flux``, ``tke_drag_coefficient`` (every one ``max_domains`` in
the Registry and admitted per domain by
``gpuwm.experiment._DOMAIN_RUN_OVERRIDES``, so a PBL parent may carry a
PBL-off LES child that names its own closure constants), the per-domain
moist-filter switch ``moist_mix6_off`` (Registry.EM_COMMON:2889,
divergence-ledger entry L4), plus
``diff_6th_thresh``, ``no_mp_heating``,
``mp_tend_lim``, ``ysu_topdown_pblmix``, ``isftcflx``, ``iz0tlnd``,
``usemonalb``, ``rdlai2d``, ``opt_thcnd`` (each emitted only when the
namelist supplies it -- their Registry defaults equal gpuwm's frozen
RunConfig defaults, so the established imports stay byte-identical).
Keys the core pins where WRF has options are validated against the
pinned value and refused otherwise (``rk_ord = 3``,
``h_mom_adv_order = 5``, ``v_mom_adv_order = v_sca_adv_order = 3``,
``momentum_adv_opt = 1``, ``use_mp_re = 1``, the
MYNN/Noah-MP/RUC option identities, supported &stoch controls, no FDDA
nudging) -- never silently reinterpreted.

Scheme-generation hazard (closed 2026-08-30): WRF v4.8.0 rebinds
``cu_physics = 3`` to Grell-Freitas-Li while adding ZERO namelist options
and changing ZERO defaults, so a v4.8.0 namelist is byte-indistinguishable
from a v4.6.1 one at the GF option level and no importer can detect which
generation was meant.  Every GF import therefore records
:data:`GF_SCHEME_GENERATION_NOTICE` in the report (rendered by ``format``,
printed by ``gpuwm import-namelist``); the one namelist spelling that DOES
reveal spreading-generation intent, ``cugd_avedx`` != 1 beside
``cu_physics = 3``, is a hard refusal naming the wrong-scheme breakage.

    """Translate namelist.wps + namelist.input into (TOML text, report).

    ``wrf_version`` names the WRF line the namelist was written for ("3"
    or "4", the CLI ``--wrf-version`` flag) and selects only the Registry
    default an OMITTED ``&dynamics/use_theta_m`` takes
    (:func:`omitted_use_theta_m`): 0 on the V3 line, 1 on V4.
    ``wrf_version_source`` says what chose that line (the flag, the
    producing files' ``TITLE``); the report records both, and the
    "Namelist defaults" row an omitted key books cites that line's
    Registry.

    ``request_source`` binds an authored route to the existing source
    request-default table even when its output filename is arbitrary.
    The ordinary file and parsed imports leave it unset, retaining their
    historical defaults. Supplied stock keys and generation selectors win.

    ``name`` sets ``[experiment].name`` (the CLI ``--name`` flag);
    the default is derived deterministically from the start time and
    domain count.  ``rrtmg_variant`` selects which gpuwm implementation a
    WRF RRTMG 4/4 request maps to. An omitted argument follows the named
    source's radiation generation, otherwise the established
    ``"rte-rrtmgp"`` substitution with byte-identical ordinary output.
    Explicit ``None`` retains WRF's legacy RRTMG selection; explicit
    ``"rrtmg_legacy"`` selects that same port and compatibility token.
    An explicit mapping wins over the named default. An omitted
    ``aer_opt=3`` request selects the implemented legacy aerosol optics.
    The returned
    TOML is validated through :func:`gpuwm.experiment.build_experiment`
    before being returned, so every section-A rule (root/child flags,
    ratios, clearance, vertical identity, cadence divisibility, derived
    dt/dx chain) binds at import time.

    ``rrtmg_compatibility`` is the SECOND fact a WRF namelist cannot
    spell about a 4/4 pair, and it was derived here instead of asked
    for.  The token is not a label: the RTE+RRTMGP arm reads it to
    choose its snow treatment and stamps it into the restart algorithm
    identity, so 'none' and the mapping token are two different runs of
    one selector pair.  Deriving it made every 4/4 import claim the
    mapping receipt, and a shipped suite that declares 'none' could not
    be written and read back as itself.  ``None`` keeps the derivation,
    so every established import stays byte-identical; a caller holding
    the authoritative configuration passes what that configuration says.

    ``acknowledgements`` carries declared-experiment acknowledgement ids
    into the emitted ``[experiment]`` table (the CLI ``--ack`` flag).  A
    WRF namelist has no spelling for a gpuwm governance declaration, so
    without this an imported configuration that needs one -- e.g. a
    shortwave-on/longwave-off pairing across a window that includes
    local night -- would refuse validation HERE, before the TOML the
    reader could have added the declaration to even exists.  Empty adds
    nothing and keeps every existing import byte-identical.

    ``wrfinput_qv_domains`` identifies native input domains whose variable
    headers contain QVAPOR. Those domains retain a moisture state even
    with microphysics off; an empty tuple preserves the generic dry
    namelist contract for that selection.

    ``static_cache_root`` is the ``cache_root`` written into the
    ``[static.highres]`` block a land-cover ``geog_data_res`` token
    (``cglc_modis_lcz``) becomes (the CLI ``--static-cache-root`` flag);
    ``None`` writes the engine's per-user high-resolution cache, the folder
    its default terrain row already uses.  A relative path is resolved
    against the TOML's own folder when it is loaded.  A namelist naming no
    land-cover token writes no block and ignores it.
