"""One certification capsule, built by one builder, emitted at every exit.

Four routes finish a forecast in this tree -- the front door's single-domain
and domain-tree exits and the two prepared runners -- and the supervisor closes
a supervised run on top of them.  Each of the five writes
``certification-capsule.json`` through :func:`emit_run_capsule`, so there is
exactly one place a field can be added, renamed or lost, and a field that goes
missing goes missing everywhere at once instead of in the route nobody reruns.

The capsule records what was measured and admits what was not.  Sections a
route cannot fill arrive as explicit ``unavailable`` markers rather than
plausible values; :func:`validate_certification_capsule` checks shape, and the
certification path additionally refuses an unresolved pin or an inventory-mode
geography digest -- a directory hashed by its listing rather than its contents
cannot witness that the geography bytes were the same bytes.
