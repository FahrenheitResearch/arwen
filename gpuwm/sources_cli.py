"""``gpuwm sources``: the human door onto the source registry.

Every fetch/prep/run refusal that has to say "this ArWen cannot do that
with that source" needs somewhere to send the reader, and until now the
only place the whole registry was legible was ``gpuwm run-plan
--sources`` -- a JSON query flag on the machine-facing execution front
door.  ``gpuwm.fetch_routes`` said so out loud and got it wrong: its
no-route refusal ended ``see: `gpuwm sources` for what each registered
source can do today``, and there was no such command.  The real parser
answered ``invalid choice: 'sources'`` at exit 2, so the one sentence a
stuck reader was handed sent them nowhere.

Handing that reader a JSON query flag instead would have been the other
half of the same mistake (ship-only-what-users-can-reach), so the
command in the sentence is the command that now exists.  It is a VIEW,
not a second source of truth: every fact printed here is copied out of
the document :func:`gpuwm.runplan.source_inventory` builds, which reads
``gpuwm.source_adapters._ADAPTERS`` and nothing else.  ``--json``
re-emits that document byte for byte, so the human and machine
spellings cannot drift.

Nothing in this module knows a model's name.  The listing's columns are
registry FIELD names, the detail view walks whatever keys the row
carries, and a row appended to the registry appears in both with no
edit here -- which is the arbitrary acceptance test, and what
``tests/test_sources_command.py`` grafts a row to prove.
