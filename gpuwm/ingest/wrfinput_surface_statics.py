"""Static and cold-start surface records the WRF-file door takes by name.

Three groups of real.exe output used to stop the door as "unmapped WRF
variable(s)" although WRF itself either never reads them under the options
this door admits, or reads them only as static data this module hands to
the physics (combo sweep round 2, 2026-10-07: 30 urban and Noah-mosaic
runs, 16 GSL drag runs, 14 topo_wind / gwd_opt runs).

* Noah mosaic cold-start state (``sf_surface_mosaic = 1``).  real.exe
  writes the tile arrays as zeros; on a non-restart launch WRF's
  ``lsm_mosaic_init`` (module_sf_noahdrv.F:4948-5350, under
  ``IF(.not.restart)``) rebuilds LANDUSEF2 and MOSAIC_CAT_INDEX from
  LANDUSEF and every ``*_MOSAIC`` carrier from the grid-cell state, which is
  what :func:`gpuwm.core.noah_mosaic_door.attach_wrfinput_noah_mosaic` does
  here.  The file's words are never read.
* Urban morphology (``sf_urban_physics > 0``).  ``urban_var_init``
  (module_sf_urban.F:2555-3050) keeps the gridded morphology only on a city
  column whose BUILD_HEIGHT (HGT_URB2D) is positive, and resets LP, LB,
  HGT, MH, STDH, LF and HI to zero everywhere else.  The port's
  ``urban_var_init_host`` takes that zero branch on every column, so the
  door accepts the morphology records and refuses, by name, a file that
  carries a positive BUILD_HEIGHT on a city column
  (:func:`require_table_urban_morphology`).  AHE, Z0_URB2D and LF_URB2D_S
  are read only by ``distributed_ahe_opt > 0`` and
  ``slucm_distributed_drag``, both refused at the namelist door.
* Sub-grid orography statistics (``topo_wind``, ``gwd_opt``).  real.exe
  copies them from geo_em into wrfinput; :func:`terrain_drag_static` reads
  the ones the selected options need and hands them to the terrain drag as
  its static field set.
