"""External scalar forcing selected by the implemented WRF operations.

WRF v4.6.1 solve_em.F:2803-2839,2904-2930: water vapour is specified;
supplied aerosols are specified when aer_init_opt > 0. Other scalar
moments retain flow-dependent boundaries unless have_bcs_scalar is set.

ANALYSED HYDROMETEORS ON THE ROOT'S SPECIFIED BOUNDARY.  WRF carries the
other moist species on a specified domain only under ``have_bcs_moist``
(WRF v4.7.1 dyn_em/solve_em.F:2265-2267 relax and spec, :2346 no
flow-dependent boundary, :4701-4703 spec_bdy_final), whose Registry
default is off (Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON:2979), and stock real.exe
writes water vapour only (main/real_em.F:956, :1156, :1374).  ArWen does
not take that default where the source publishes the hydrometeors: a
flow-dependent boundary has zero inflow, so an analysed cloud or snow
field drains out of the domain and is never resupplied (a HRRR-forced
two-hour winter case kept 1.0 million t of snow over its inner domain
against the 3.1 in HRRR's own analysis).  Which masses a source publishes
on EVERY forcing frame is a fact of its table row: the canonical
hydrometeor fields its mapping declares (:func:`mapping_boundary_species`)
or, for a native route whose inventory lives in its decoder, the row's
``boundary_species`` column (:func:`source_boundary_species`).  A source
that publishes none keeps water vapour only, byte for byte.

THE NUMBER MOMENTS AT THE RING.  WRF's ``have_bcs_scalar``
(solve_em.F:2812-2815, :2912-2917) specifies every scalar.  Here the ring
carries exactly the number moments the cold start seeds from the masses it
carries (:data:`COLD_START_SEEDED_NUMBERS`: real.exe's make_RainNumber and
make_IceNumber on mp=8 and mp=28, and make_DropletNumber on mp=28), taken
from the same forcing frame.  Every forcing frame is initialized through
the same cold start as the start time, so the ring's number is the one
the rule gives its own analysed mass, and the ring's sizes are the start
state's sizes.  Left flow-dependent the ring would bring the analysed
mass in with zero number, and Thompson's entry block would size it at its
limits (2.5 mm rain, drizzle-sized droplets).  A scheme whose cold start
seeds no number (WSM6, Morrison, WDM6, NSSL, Milbrandt-Yau, P3) keeps its
numbers flow-dependent, which is the zero the start state gives them too.
