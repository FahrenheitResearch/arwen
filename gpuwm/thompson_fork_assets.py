"""Acquire the exact WRF 3.9 fork coefficient set without changing its pins.

The set is published as four release assets of every release from 2.8.7 on
(``thompson-wrf39-noaa-<table>``; tools/release/cut/identities.py names them
and the cut uploads them).  A machine with no named source downloads them
from its own release, then from the first release that carried them, each
file verified against :data:`gpuwm.core.thompson_contract.FORK_TABLE_ASSETS`
before it is installed.  The set can also come from a local directory
(``--from``, ``GPUWM_THOMPSON_FORK_TABLE_SOURCE_ROOT``), from
gpuwm-data/data/thompson/wrf39-noaa, or from an explicitly selected mirror.
When no route answers, the runtime builds unchanged, hash-pinned public
Fortran inputs with a pinned portable libc on a local CPU. Every route
enforces the same canonical manifest before installation. Different
official HRRR floating-point bytes are refused.

    a failed transfer can leave verified files to resume, never wrong bytes.
    All consumers enter this transaction before reading the selected set.

    partial files and could publish a receipt describing the other one's
    bytes.  What the verification still prevents: fork kernels reading a root
    whose bytes differ from the pins in FORK_TABLE_ASSETS (a damaged file, a
    foreign build's floating-point bytes), whose tables index the fork's
    records wrongly and change the physics silently.
