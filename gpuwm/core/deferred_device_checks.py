"""Device-side guards read once per radiation call instead of once per chunk.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS (A3, 2026-10-05): the legacy RRTMG call runs its
columns in chunks sized to the card's resident threads (2,048 LW and 2,560 SW
columns on an RTX 5090), and five guards inside each chunk read a flag back to
the host: the LW and SW cloud-property abort words, the SW day-column
contract, the prep night gate and the McICA seed guard.  Each read waits for
the card to drain, so the host could never queue the next chunk while the card
worked on this one.  Measured on one RTX 5090 at 360,000 columns: 317 chunks,
1,164 device reads and 141 device-wide synchronizations, 0.94 s of a 3.1 s
call spent waiting in them.

Inside :func:`deferred` a guard records its device flag and its verdict and
returns at once; the scope reads every recorded flag in ONE transfer when it
closes and runs the verdicts in the order they were recorded, so the first
failing guard raises the same exception with the same message it raised
before.  Nothing the call returns is visible to the caller before the scope
closes, so a failed guard still means no result is used.  Outside a scope
:func:`check` reads the flag at once, exactly as before.  A guard flag must
be a value nothing writes after the check is recorded (copy reused scratch).
