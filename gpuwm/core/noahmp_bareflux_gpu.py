"""Batched CUDA execution of Noah-MP's BARE_FLUX subtree.

The arithmetic lives in ``gpuwm/core/kernels/noahmp_bareflux.cu``, whose
``d_bare_flux`` body is already held at max_ulp 0 against the unmodified WRF
v4.6.1 leaf oracle (``noahmp-bareflux.csv``), with its glibc ``logf``/``atanf``
and its ESAT coefficient table separately probed on the device.  This module
supplies the runtime-facing part the oracle harness did not: the physical
Python call is packed in column order, all columns are evaluated by one CUDA
launch, and the rows are unpacked as :class:`BareFluxOut` records.

Two things this deliberately does not do:

* It does not compile with any translation-unit-wide flag.  The kernel pins
  every FP32 operation with a rounding intrinsic and keeps every constant in
  ``__constant__`` memory, so ``-fmad`` is not load-bearing and a global flag
  would silently move unrelated arithmetic if the source is composed later.
* It does not touch ``glibc_powf``.  ``d_bare_flux`` never calls it -- only
  ``powi3``/``powi4`` (integer powers, written as multiplies) and
  ``glibc_logf`` are on the live path -- so this seam neither depends on nor
  widens that leaf's narrow subnormal/negative-base domain guard.

Unlike ``noahmp_vegeflux_gpu``, no coefficient table is uploaded from the host:
``noahmp_bareflux.cu`` carries every constant it needs as a ``__constant__``
bit-pattern array of its own, which is what
``tests/test_noahmp_bareflux_cuda.py`` probes.
