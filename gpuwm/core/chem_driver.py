"""The chem step: WRF-Chem's ``chem_driver`` as one operator per model step.

WRF runs chemistry after the whole dynamics and physics step
(``share/solve_interface.F``: ``solve_em`` then ``chem_driver``).  ArWen does
the same from the end of :func:`gpuwm.core.dycore.step`, after microphysics,
so tiles and nests reach it through that step with no extra wiring.

Inside the step the order is WRF's (``chem/chem_driver.F``): emissions with
plume rise (:818), optics on radiation steps (:926), deposition velocities
and vertical mixing with deposition as its lower boundary (:1049), settling,
the (GOCART sulfur) mechanism (:1242), aerosol aging (:1577), large-scale wet
removal (:1620/:1689), then the Thompson coupling (an ArWen addition, DESIGN
6.7).  :data:`CHEM_STEP_ORDER` is that order as process keys; a process runs
when an active row names it, and decides its own cadence (``chemdt``,
radiation steps, WRF's ``ktau > 2`` for deposition) from ``ctx.clock``.  The
PM sums and the other table diagnostics (:1700) depend only on the fields at
output time, so :mod:`gpuwm.core.chem_outputs` evaluates them when a history
frame is written rather than every step.

The mass ledger files every kilogram of every transported row: the dycore's
change (advection, lateral boundaries, the positive-definite clamp, and
anything else that moved the fields between chem steps, such as nest
feedback) under ``transport``, and each process's change under its declared
``LEDGER`` bucket, measured by the driver before and after the process so a
process cannot book mass itself.  The accounting telescopes by construction
(``initial + sum(buckets) == current`` in float64), so it is a budget, not a
proof; that the transport itself conserves mass is proven by the tests on
periodic and zero-inflow domains.  Its vectors are ``chemdiag_ledger_*``
DomainState attributes, so a checkpoint carries it and a resumed run keeps
counting.
