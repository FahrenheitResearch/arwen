"""The short version of ``gpuwm domain``, for a person at a terminal.

``gpuwm domain`` takes three required flags, so typing it bare answers
with argparse's usage dump and exit 2.  That is the correct answer to a
script and the wrong one to a person: the owner's reaction to it was
"so we don't have an easier way of doing it?".  There is now.  On a
terminal, bare ``gpuwm domain`` asks four questions and runs.

Two rules shape everything here.

**The prompts collect values; they do not build anything.**  A session
produces an ordinary ``argv`` list of the same flags a user could have
typed, and that list goes through the same parser into the same
:func:`gpuwm.domain_wizard.domain_main`.  There is no second sizing
path, no second validator, and no way for the two front doors to drift
into emitting different files -- the equivalence is by construction
rather than by a test that has to keep noticing.  The session also
prints the command it assembled, so the flag form is learned by using
the short one.

**Interactivity is layered exactly like verbosity.**  A hidden prompt
that a CI job can block on is a worse failure than a usage error, so
the prompt session requires BOTH stdin and stdout to be terminals.
Redirected, piped, or under a scheduler, bare ``gpuwm domain`` keeps
today's behaviour to the letter: usage on stderr, exit 2.  Any flag at
all also means the caller knows what they want, and the old path runs
untouched.

#: Two features that do not compose is not a feature.  This door ruled
#: that first; the flags door's ``--ladder`` default was still ``auto``
#: until the 4090 user-zero run met the same refusal there, and now
#: both doors default to this shape (register_cli in
#: :mod:`gpuwm.domain_wizard`).  Nests are explicit opt-in on either:
#: a deeper preset, ``auto``, or ``--root-dx``/``--chain``.
