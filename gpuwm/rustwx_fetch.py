"""Locate and drive the vendored Rust fetch backbone (``rw_fetch``).

``gpuwm fetch --engine rust`` moves bytes through ``rw_fetch``, the
sixth binary of the vendored ``tools/rustwx`` workspace, instead of
through the stdlib ``urllib`` transports in :mod:`tools`.  What that
buys is machinery ArWen would otherwise have to reimplement:

* **16 MiB parallel whole-file range GETs** -- one 700 MB serial TCP
  stream becomes a bounded few concurrent ones (``wx-core``
  ``get_bytes_parallel_whole``; :data:`STREAMS_ENV` sets how many), each
  resumed from the byte it reached when its body breaks off or stalls;
* **``.idx`` range coalescing** -- a 561-record selection collapses to a
  handful of GETs (``idx.rs:376`` ``byte_ranges`` plus coalescing);
* **the cross-process NOMADS rate governor** (``client.rs:178-232``) --
  a lock file and shared state enforcing a 2.5 s minimum inter-request
  gap and a 15-minute node-wide cooldown when Akamai's malformed
  over-rate-limit response is fingerprinted.  It is shared state, so a
  ``rw_fetch`` subprocess and any other rusty-weather process on the
  box cooperate rather than racing each other into an IP block;
* **a two-tier disk cache** keyed by URL and byte range.

Everything durable stays in Python.  ``rw_fetch`` reports what it did;
:mod:`gpuwm.fetch` decides what that means -- the
``gpuwm-fetch-manifest-v1`` manifest, the request-identity resume
guard, quarantine-not-delete, and the record-count bars.

Like the GRIB bridges and the batch renderer, the pip wheel ships no
compiled Rust: the binary is built once from the vendored workspace
(``cargo build --release --locked --offline``) and then *pointed at*,
with the same resolution ladder as :mod:`gpuwm.bridges`:

1. the ``GPUWM_RW_FETCH`` environment variable naming the built file
   (a missing file it names is a hard error, never silently skipped);
2. a source checkout's ``tools/rustwx/target/{release,debug}``;
3. ``<root>/libexec/bridges`` beside the package;
4. ``~/.gpuwm/bridges``.

Nothing here runs cargo.  Resolution has one side effect and one
only: an artifact found in ``~/.gpuwm/bridges`` that is not the one this
release pinned is re-fetched before it is handed to a door
(:func:`gpuwm.bridges.require_release_pin`).  ``gpuwm doctor`` resolves
inside :func:`gpuwm.bridges.inspection_only`, where there is no side
effect at all, so the report still says what the estate IS.
