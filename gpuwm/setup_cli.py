"""``gpuwm setup``: the staging steps a wheel install still needs.

``pip install gpuwm`` lands the Python half and nothing else.  The wheel
ships no compiled Rust -- every GRIB decode goes through the fail-closed
bridges -- and the two largest Thompson tables are published as release
assets because they exceed PyPI's per-file cap.  Both gaps already had a
one-command fix; what they did not have was ONE command.  A first
install therefore read as a list of chores whose order and necessity the
reader had to infer, which is the half of the install complaint that no
amount of message layering fixes.

So this is a wrapper, deliberately thin.  Each step is
:mod:`gpuwm.bridge_assets` or :mod:`gpuwm.table_assets` doing exactly
what it does when invoked directly -- same verification, same pins, same
refusals, same exit codes -- and this module adds only sequencing, one
line of status per step, and a closing doctor summary.  Nothing new
downloads anything, so there is no second implementation to drift.

**Static geography is opt in.**  ``gpuwm fetch-geog`` unpacks tens of
gigabytes, which is not a thing to start on someone's behalf because
they typed a command called ``setup``.  ``--with-geog`` asks for it, and
prints the size -- read off the pin table, never a literal -- before the
first byte moves.

**Re-run safe**, because every step is: staged artifacts that match
their pins are verified and skipped, so a second ``gpuwm setup`` is a
verification pass.  The wrapper adds no state of its own -- no marker
file, no "already done" short circuit -- precisely so that a re-run
after a partial or corrupted first run does the checking rather than
trusting a flag.
