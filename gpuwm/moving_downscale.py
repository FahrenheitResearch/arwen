"""``gpuwm downscale --follow``: a step-down that moves.

Two things can move in a step-down, and this door handles both.

THE PARENT MOVES.  A storm run's following nest writes every history frame
where the nest was at that instant, so its frames do not share one grid and
``gpuwm downscale`` (which places its child once on one parent grid) refuses
them.  Every frame of such a nest still lies on ONE lattice: a nest moves by
whole cells of its own parent, so its cells always land on the same ground
points.  This door reads each frame's place on that lattice off the frame
itself (its first mass point through the parent's own projection,
:func:`frame_footprints`), so any producer's moving frames are read on their
own footprint.  For each stretch of the run it cuts, from every frame of the
stretch, the same window of ground (:func:`crop_frame`): a parent archive
that no longer moves, which the ordinary offline child reads unchanged.

THE CHILD MOVES.  A following child is a sequence of ordinary offline
children, one per ``--follow-every`` seconds, each placed where the storm
will be over its stretch (:func:`plan_segments`): ``storm`` follows the
parent run's storm track (``storm-track.dNN.csv``, written by the storm
tracker), or the moving parent's own centre when the run wrote none;
``parent`` keeps the child's place inside the moving parent; ``fixed``
holds it on the ground.  A segment is joined to the one before it the way a
moving nest's move is: it starts from the parent at its new placement and
then carries the earlier segment's last checkpoint, bitwise, onto every cell
both placements cover (:mod:`gpuwm.offline_child_warm`), and the freshly
covered strip takes the parent's accumulated rain since the child began
(:func:`strip_accumulations`).  So the forecast continues across a move
instead of spinning up again; only the strip starts from the parent.

THE RECORD.  The run folder holds one frame per output time (the segments'
own frames, hard-linked in time order), the last segment's final checkpoint
(so the run is itself a parent for a further step, moving or not), the maps,
and ``moving-child.json``: every segment's window, placement, move and
receipt, and every frame's footprint, so a further step can be checked
inside it.  The frames are ONE moving nest's history: every segment writes
the child's start as its START_DATE and its place on the parent's lattice as
I/J_PARENT_START, so a reader joins them across the moves as it joins a
moving nest's frames, and the windows that span a segment's start (1 h
rain, the 1 h maxima) are drawn over the run's own frames once each segment
ends (:func:`draw_run_windows`).  A run-total window (1 h rain, the 6/12/24 h
totals) on ground the grid reached during the window has no start value in
the grid's own frames, so it is drawn again from a start on the grid's end
place that takes the parent's rain since the child began there
(:func:`draw_window_starts`).
