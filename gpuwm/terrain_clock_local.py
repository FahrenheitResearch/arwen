"""The terrain clock read face by face: ``terrain_clock = "local_face"``.

THE DEFAULT CLOCK from 2.8.8 (it was a default-off candidate before).
Every domain whose run leaves ``terrain_clock`` unset, or names
``"local_face"`` (the key in an experiment, or a
``! gpuwm-physics-selectors-v1`` comment line in a WRF namelist), reads
it; ``"measured"`` (the shipped domain-wide clock) and ``"pinned"`` stay
selectable.  It is never worse than ``"measured"`` (:func:`never_worse`).
The flip rests on the six long cases (NCAR CONUS 12 km and 2.5 km, LA
Santa Ana, SF Diablo, Toronto, Boston): each runs a decision a 48 h or
full-window run already held (CLOCK-CHECK-NCAR-2026-10-06, fix/step3 to
fix/step7).

THE DEFECT IT ANSWERS.  The shipped clock (:mod:`gpuwm.terrain_clock`)
reads one triple per domain: the steepest slope anywhere, the highest
ground anywhere, and the strongest crest-band wind anywhere.  On NCAR's
v4.4 CONUS benchmarks that put a Plains jet (48 m/s at 12 km, 52 m/s at
2.5 km) and a San Juan or Front Range crest on a Sierra face hundreds of
km away, and halved both published steps (72 s to 36 s, 15 s to 7.5 s),
where both grids ran clean at NCAR's own steps (peak WRF vertical Courant
0.52 and 0.57, w_damping never acted; CLOCK-CHECK-NCAR-2026-10-06).

WHAT IT READS.  Every cell face of the domain, not only the steepest:

* its slope, the substep rule's own per-face reading
  (:func:`gpuwm.acoustic_adaptation.face_slopes`);
* its crest: the highest ground in its NEIGHBOURHOOD, the square window of
  :func:`neighbourhood_cells` cells around each of the face's two mass
  columns;
* its crest-level wind: the strongest wind over the same window, from the
  ground up to the first model level at or above the crest band's top,
  over every input the shipped clock reads (start state, the root's
  boundary data over the window, the forcing snapshots over the window);
  each column's band runs up to the highest ground within ``2R + 1``
  cells of it, which is at least the crest of every face whose window
  holds the column, so a column never reads a shallower band than a face
  over it asks for;
* that wind times :data:`WIND_MARGIN`, and never more than the shipped
  domain-wide reading (the strongest wind the inputs carry anywhere, which
  is what the shipped clock reads for every face), but never less than
  :data:`INPUT_WIND_FLOOR` times the face's own input wind
  (:func:`face_wind_read`).  Breakage the cap prevents: a refusal resting
  on a wind no input carries anywhere in the window (the margin times a
  face's own wind past the domain's strongest); on both NCAR benchmark
  grids no face's wind in NCAR's own forecast passed the domain-wide
  reading at any output hour.  Breakage the floor prevents: on the HRRR
  long-run cases the interior jet passed that reading over the faces
  under its core (LA Santa Ana, 1.14 x a step-setting face's own input),
  which moved LA's cap (:data:`INPUT_WIND_FLOOR`).

Each face is read on the map exactly as the shipped clock reads its one
triple (:func:`gpuwm.terrain_clock.read_map`: next steeper slope row,
taller crest row, stronger wind column, every gentler row and weaker
wind), and the domain is held to the least of all of them: a step stands
only where every face's reading holds it.  Faces that read the same map
cells read the same answer, so the faces are grouped by the cells they
read and each group is read once; the receipt records, per group, the
face that leads it (its steepest), its own crest, wind and position, and
what the map said there.

THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, MEASURED ON THE MAP'S OWN RIDGES.  Each map row is a
bell ridge of a stated crest and ridge slope; the window must reach from
the ridge's steepest grid face to its crest, or the local reading would
read that ridge under a lower crest than the row was measured under.  On
every row the map holds at a spacing, that distance is at most 22 cells
at 500 m, 16 at 1 km, 16 at 2 km (the candidate's 4500 m crest, slope
0.05 ridge), 10 at 3 km, 7 at 4 km, 10 at 6 km, 6 at 9 km and 5 at 12 km
(the widest shipped ridges, crest 8.85 km at slope 0.05 to 0.2).  A
domain takes the longest such distance, in metres, over the mapped
spacings it reads (both neighbours of a spacing between two), in whole
cells of its own spacing: 60 km (5 cells) at 12 km, 32 km (13 cells) at
2.5 km.  A shorter window would read a face of a mapped ridge under a
lower crest than the ridge it stands on, so a narrower one is not
measured evidence for it.  :func:`neighbourhood_cells` derives it from the map's
rows at load, so the window follows the map.

THE WIND MARGIN.  The start state and boundary data say nothing about the
wind a face will see later in the window: over NCAR's 12 km Sierra face
the start state carried 11 m/s and NCAR's own forecast 25 m/s across the
face by f012, 2.3 x (REVIEW.md section 4 item 6).  A face's wind is read
at :data:`WIND_MARGIN` times what its window's inputs carry; its
docstring holds the measurement it was checked against.

THE ROWS.  The rows measured for this candidate
(:data:`CANDIDATE_MAP_PATH`): 2, 3 and 12 km; crests 3000, 3500 and 4500
m; ridge slopes 0.05 to 0.40 (grid slopes from 0.049, including 0.089 to
0.10 and NCAR's 12 km 0.0915); 20 to 60 m/s; 6.5 down to 3 s/km; three
hours each; 4 and 6 substeps; at the generated dynamics and at NCAR's.
Every row was swept directly under the held test decided on 2026-10-07
(lead decision (i)): a step HOLDS where its run stays finite for the full
three hours with peak w under ten times the map's old bound
``4 x wind x slope + 20`` m/s, and (lead decision 3 after step 5) with
peak |w| under 100 m/s (``tools/terrain_clock_probe.py``
``BLOWUP_PEAK_W``): every run behind the rows was re-read under it, and
the two fixed entries and fifteen adaptive rows that rested on a run past
100 m/s were walked on down (the map's ``peak_rule``, fix/step6).  1,345 of those cells (every cell either
NCAR grid reads at or above its step, the cells deciding the four HRRR
long-run cases, every held run still growing in its last hour and the
deciding cells' row neighbours) were run again for 12 hours on the wider
domain the probe sizes for 12 hours; the 40 that came out one rung shorter
carry their 12-hour entry (the map's ``long_probes``; every flip stopped
inside 2.6 hours, so the three-hour domain was too narrow, not too short).
The adaptive clock's entries on the 2 and 3 km rows of crests 3000 to
4500 m (and, at NCAR's dynamics, of the 1500 m crest at ridges 0.1 to
0.25) are the 12-hour blow-up-test ones (:data:`ADAPTIVE_ROWS_PATH`).
At 70 m/s the candidate ran the 192 NCAR-dynamics cells of the 2 and 3
km rows that LA Santa Ana's parent grid reads at the input-wind floor,
12 hours each under the same test (the map's ``wind_70_probes``, fix/
step5): read there before, those faces took the shipped map's 70 m/s
cells, measured under the retired old bound.  At the 1.5 floor (fix/step6)
the same faces read 80 m/s, and the 192 cells there were run the same way
under the 100 m/s peak rule (the map's ``wind_80_probes``); three of them
(2 km, 4500 m crest, ridges 0.15 and 0.2) hold no step at all, which
takes LA's parent grid's face-by-face reading past the map (BEYOND_MEASURED),
so that grid keeps the shipped clock's decision (:func:`never_worse`).  Breakage the change prevents: the old
bound alone stopped finite, steady mountain waves on gentle 2 and 3 km
ridges at every step down to 3 s/km (MEASURE.md finding 1), a refusal
naming no breakage; every 12 km cell it stopped also ran away under the
new test, so the 12 km stops stand.  The 3500 m crest rows are measured
ridges, not a rounding: the faces that set both NCAR grids' limits stand
under 3398 m (12 km) and 3420 m (2.5 km) local crests, which the 3000 and
4500 m rows alone read as 4500 m ridges, a third taller than the ground.

Each arm reads every shipped row, merged with its own three-hour row on
the same ridge where there is one (:func:`merge_cell`: the three-hour row
decides every step it tried, both ways, lead decision (iii); the shipped
row only steps longer than any it tried), plus its rows on ridges the
shipped map never ran (:func:`candidate_map`; :func:`moved_rows` lists
every shipped row that moved).  A domain reads the arm measured at its own
dynamics (:func:`dynamics_arms`), both where its dynamics match neither.
No slope is rounded to a gentler row: a face steeper than a row reads the
next steeper one, as the shipped clock does.

WHAT IT DOES NOT READ LOCALLY.  A following (moving) nest's corridor: it
can move over ground its start window never saw, so it keeps the shipped
domain-wide reading.  A domain whose faces cannot be read with the map
factors the substep rule read (:func:`gpuwm.acoustic_adaptation
.steepest_slope`), so its steepest face would not be the substep rule's,
also keeps the domain-wide reading.  The receipt says which and why.
