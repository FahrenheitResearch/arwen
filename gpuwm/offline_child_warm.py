"""A downscaled child that starts warm from an earlier child of itself.

``gpuwm downscale --warm-from CHECKPOINT --warm-shift DI,DJ`` builds the
child at its placement from the parent exactly as a cold start does, then
carries what an earlier child at a nearby placement had integrated over the
ground both share.  It is the offline counterpart of a moving nest's move
(:mod:`gpuwm.core.nest_relocation`), and it uses the same pieces:

* the restart layer's serialised state (:func:`gpuwm.core.nest_relocation.
  relocatable_attrs`) is stamped bitwise onto the overlap by
  :func:`gpuwm.core.nest_relocation.transplant_overlap`, with the same
  index-space window (``dst[d] <- src[d + shift]``);
* the land-surface continuation fields (:data:`gpuwm.ingest.relocation_init.
  LAND_SURFACE_CONTINUATION_FIELDS`) and the accumulated-precipitation slots
  (:data:`gpuwm.core.physics_continuation.STRIP_ACCUMULATORS`) follow the
  same window;
* the EOS diagnostics are re-derived against the child's own base state,
  as :func:`gpuwm.ingest.relocation_init.rederive_after_transplant` does
  after a move, and the RK time-t copies are re-seeded.

The freshly covered strip keeps the cold start from the parent.  Its
accumulated precipitation is the parent's since the first segment began
(the moving runner writes it, :func:`gpuwm.moving_downscale.
strip_accumulations`), so a rain total has no band of too little rain along
the leading edge, the rule WRF applies to a moving nest's exposed cells; the
earlier child's specified ring, where it lands inside the new one, takes the
parent's too (its microphysics never ran there).

``DI,DJ`` is the move in CHILD cells, new placement minus old: a child that
moved one parent cell east at ratio 3 is ``3,0``.  The earlier checkpoint
must have this child's shape; anything else is refused by name.
