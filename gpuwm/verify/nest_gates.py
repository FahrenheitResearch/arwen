"""Pre-registered Phase-5 nesting milestone gate tables (N0-N6 + Phase-5b).

GATES-FIRST discipline (design decision D7; architecture doc section F):
every milestone-ladder gate -- definition AND numeric threshold -- is
registered here BEFORE any ARC-B implementing lane merges, and the rung
executors (Task 8(c) cases, Task 14) consume ONLY these records.  Numeric
thresholds are verbatim from the ratified architecture document

    docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-phase5-nesting-architecture.md

section F ("Milestone ladder") AS AMENDED (the doc's F-numbered amendment
record is the ratification trail; F15 ratifies the external-review rows
below); each record's ``anchor`` names its rung
paragraph.  A threshold may be loosened ONLY by controller plan amendment
with the N1.5 attribution run in hand -- never against "physics differ"
hand-waving.  ``tests/test_nest_gates.py`` pins every number and the full
table inventory, so any edit to this ledger fails the suite and forces the
amendment to be visible in the diff.

Two thresholds required interpretation, both flagged in-record and both
RATIFIED by the 2026-07-16 controller amendment (post red-team):

- N1.5 registers an "~1e-6 band"; the pre-registered numeric value is
  ``1.0e-6`` (FP32-relative, order-of-ops differences only).
- N2(c) names a "boundary_zone_blowup-style w gate"; the N3 family value
  ``0.5`` is the ratified bound (architecture section F N2(c) as amended;
  plan Task 8(a)).

AMENDED 2026-07-16 (controller amendment after red-team verification):

- F10: executable comparator semantics per bound kind (:data:`COMPARATORS`);
  every kind BLOCKS except ``diagnostic``.
- F11: ``alloc_estimate_le_wddm_budget`` at N0 and the N5 re-check --
  the full enforced chain is measured <= estimate <= measured budget.
- F12: N6 blocking hard-gate records (completion/zero validator fires,
  output inventory, peak <= estimate, abort-threshold compliance).
- F13: the CLOSING milestone (Phase-5 closing gate, executed this phase)
  is distinct from P5B; feedback=0 bit-inertness is proven by a runtime
  FEEDBACK-call-path bypass A/B, not a pre/post-tests-only-merge diff.
- F8/F9: schedule-pin and N1.5 field-list conventions updated per the
  amended architecture (terminal feedback guard; moist AND scalar tables).

AMENDED 2026-07-16 (F15, external-review adjudication, controller-ratified
in the architecture doc's amendment record): comparator kind split
(``fp64_mirror_floor``/``fp32_state_equiv``/``real_emulation_mirror``) and
eleven additive blocking records (N5S matched-physics shadow, N5B
boundary-location invariance, ancestor inertness at every output,
validator invocation/frame counts, d04 budget/clipping residuals, N6
high-frequency time-max products, quantitative refl/updraft companions)
plus required evidence-manifest fields for N5/N6 blockers.  Additive or
strictly tightening only; the 73-row base ledger is byte-identical (proven
by the amendment's adversarial review, p5ext-gates-review.md).

All child dynamics gates inherit the ratified physics substitutions (the
reference ran ISHMAEL mp=55 + Shin-Hong bl_pbl=11; gpuwm runs
Morrison+YSU), which is WHY the child gates are statistical while every
parent-protection gate is bitwise.

AMENDED 2026-07-16 (F17, controller amendment WITH the N1.5 attribution
run in hand -- the register's sanctioned loosening path, executed in
full): the N1/N3 blended HGT/MUB static thresholds move 0.5 m -> 1.5 m
and 10 Pa -> 17 Pa.  Evidence chain (out/n1-measure/attribution.json +
the ledger): (a) CHAIN ISOLATION IS BIT-EXACT -- pushing the bundle's
own inputs (geo_em child HGT_M + reference parent wrfout HGT) through
gpuwm's GPU SINT+blend chain reproduces the reference blended child HGT
with max |diff| = 0.0 on the FULL GRID for d02/d03/d04, so the measured
miss is 100% input-attributed; (b) the input is the RATIFIED Phase-3
static terrain residual (unblended-vs-geo_em fine residual 2.918 m d02 /
2.166 m d03 / 0.175 m d04, cascading through the parent chain); (c) the
MUB miss is the HGT miss propagated hydrostatically (measured slope
-11.1..-11.5 Pa/m = -rho*g, correct sign).  New values = measured worst
(1.185 m / 13.17 Pa) + ~25% headroom; 17 Pa = 1.5 m x 11.4 Pa/m; the
input-residual ceiling (2.92 m) bounds any possible leak.  The
loosening is paired with three ADDITIVE TIGHTENING records
(``d0X_chain_isolation_bit_exact``): the machinery itself is now pinned
at bit-exactness, infinitely sharper than the numeric bound it
replaces as the chain-error detector.

AMENDED 2026-07-16 (F18, same attribution run): the N1.5 tendency
comparator treats the four ``state.t.*.tendency`` tables at the FP32
successor scale E = fl32(VALUE + fl32(cdt*TENDENCY)) -- exactly the
expression WRF's boundary consumer applies -- under the UNCHANGED 1e-6
band.  This is the registered treatment of the PROVENANCE "N1.5 harness
seam -- dumped-WRF theta restoration" (harness-only inverse
representation map, production-absent; empirically attributed by the
p5n15 numerics shadow: substituting direct t_2 coupling gives 882,000/
882,000 bit-identical theta elements).  All other tables keep the raw
registered comparator -- the u/v low-face misses the same run exposed
were a REAL production defect, FIXED (p5n15 80eebb4) to full bit
identity, and MUST NOT be absorbed by any tolerance.  A new additive
record pins the producer's stored-recurrence hard check.

AMENDED 2026-07-16 (F19, N2 identity-rung attribution -- p5n2attr
shadow report, adversarially derived + measured): the N2(a)/N2(b)
records re-kind fp32_state_equiv -> identity_oracle.  The
pre-registered post-t=0 full-state 8-ULP equivalence compared two
INTENTIONALLY DIFFERENT equations (periodic parent vs Davies child;
the specified operator branch reassociates FP32 arithmetic tilewide
from the first flux evaluation), so no correct implementation could
pass it; the measured divergence is physically negligible (t=0
bit-exact; boundary-frame <= 5e-3 relative at t=60) and every defect
hypothesis (w substeps, orientation/corners, tendency denominator,
the interior-first mup signal) was ruled out at bit level.  The
replacement composite oracle is STRICTLY SHARPER where it binds:
bit-exact force tables (measured 0.00 field-scale ULP), successor
reconstruction <= 2 field-scale ULP (measured 0.125), an independent
Davies-formula oracle, nested-w substep bit identity (measured 7/7
exact), and empirical raw specified-row caps at 2x run envelope.
Not a loosening: a correction of what the rung compares, paired with
oracles that catch every fault class the old comparison targeted,
loudly.

AMENDED 2026-07-17 (F20, first N3 hardware attribution -- controller
bisection to a one-line cause): the N3(i) d01 byte-ratchet text now
names its ratified exceptions explicitly and records the root-dtbc
adjudication.  The first N3 run failed d01-vs-Phase-4 with a whole-
domain 13:00 divergence; controller bisection proved t=0 byte-identity,
nested-vs-control byte-identity (the non-mutating-coupling property the
gate protects HOLDS), production-path trunk cleanliness (1-hour cardinal
re-run byte-identical, with and without mid-run checkpoint writes), and
step-1 divergence confined to the Davies relaxation zone with byte-
identical step inputs.  Cause: the tree build bound the root's external-
boundary clock, switching root Davies launches from the frozen Phase-4
elapsed-based dtbc to WRF's post-increment dtbc_launch_fp32 (one dt of
boundary target time).  Adjudication: root stays UNBOUND (frozen-bytes
authority); the WRF post-increment recurrence remains child-only where
the N1.5 oracle pins it; the root-side WRF deviation is registered in
PROVENANCE.md.  TITLE joins the ratified exception list as descriptive
metadata (value excluded, presence required, both values recorded in
evidence).  No numeric threshold changes; the byte comparator is
otherwise untouched.

AMENDED 2026-07-28 (Davies clock bind -- the F20 adjudication is
RETIRED): the production tree build now binds the root's external
boundary clock, so root Davies launches consume WRF's post-increment
dtbc (solve_em.F:371-372) and the bound final ring owns the OLD record
at dtbc=T_bdy on pre-seam steps (solve_em.F:4531-4639).  The frozen
Phase-4/-r2 anchor bytes encode the retired elapsed-based semantics and
can no longer serve as the byte authority; the d01/d02/d03 invariance
ratchets regenerate against the seam-closure anchor epoch
(real74-t7-final-r3) in the batched end-of-Wave-1 regeneration.  The
ratchet metric NAMES keep their historic d01_bitwise_vs_phase4_13z
identity; what they protect is unchanged (gpuwm-invariance --
non-mutating coupling -- not WRF identity).  Restart headers gained the
root_external_lbc_clock semantic identity so pre-bind checkpoints fail
closed (gpuwm/io/restart.py).

AMENDED 2026-07-17 (F21, N3 FSS matched-physics attribution -- the
registered attribution path executed in full): the child REFL_10CM FSS
rows now score against a MATCHED-PHYSICS WRF reference where one is
registered in MATCHED_REFERENCE_FRAMES, at the UNCHANGED thresholds
(0.90/0.80/0.70).  Basis, three-way d02 comparison at 13:15Z with the
registered formula (out/rungs/N3-fss-attribution.json): gpuwm vs
matched-WRF (Morrison mp=10 + YSU both sides) = 0.9818/0.9830/0.9734;
matched-WRF vs the mp55 bundle reference = 0.3935/0.0787/0.0050; gpuwm
vs mp55 = 0.4114/0.0830/0.0073.  Real WRF under the gpuwm physics suite
scores the same as gpuwm against the mp55 reference, so THIS registered
d02/13:15 FSS miss at these thresholds and scales is attributable to
physics selection (the claim is scoped to this metric: it does not
assert absence of model error elsewhere), and like-for-like agreement
clears every threshold.  The matched reference is the node-generated bundle
gpuwm-wrf-matched-mp10-ysu-19740403-v1 (WRF v4.6.1 dmpar 48-rank,
mp=10/bl=1/sfclay=91/use_theta_m=0/do_radar_ref=1; deviations on
record: one-way nesting feedback=0 and MPI decomposition, both absorbed
by the 0.97+ like-for-like scores).  Frame consumption is SHA-256
pinned.  All other statistical rows (MSLP correlation, T500/T850 RMSE,
blowup, structure) keep the mp55 references untouched; domains without
a registered matched reference (d03/d04) keep the mp55 FSS reference
and BLOCK until a matched reference is registered -- extending the
matched run to max_dom=4 is the registered path.  Not a loosening:
thresholds, formula, mask, and family are unchanged; only the FSS
reference identity is corrected to like-for-like physics.

AMENDED 2026-07-17 (F22, controller geometry adjudication before any N5B
execution): the N5B shrink is 51 cells per side (498x498), not the
originally drafted 50 (500x500).  Exact 50-per-side is unrepresentable:
the d04 anchor lives on the ratio-3 parent lattice, and 50 is not
divisible by 3, so no integer i/j_parent_start can make the two centered
400x400 cores coincide (the machinery's coordinate-identity preflight
correctly refused to run).  51/side is the nearest symmetric realizable
shrink: anchor shift 51/3 = 17 parent cells exactly (151 -> 168), the
shrink stays parent-aligned (498 = 3 x 166, matching WRF's e_we-1
divisibility rule that 500 would violate), and the centered cores --
production [100:500]^2, shrink [49:449]^2 -- coincide cell-for-cell,
enforced by the pre-existing XLAT/XLONG SHA-equality preflight.  Not a
loosening: every predicate, threshold, and the pre-look envelope
procedure are untouched; only the B-geometry two numbers changed, and
they changed BEFORE any A/B run or metric was produced.

AMENDED 2026-07-17 (F23, first N4 execution -- canonical digest scope):
the rung-evidence canonical state digest gains a TRAJECTORY scope that
excludes CHILD_DUTY_SCRATCH_MEMBERS (currently the coupler's
scratch/nest_parent_field staging slot), with the scope baked into the
digest seed so scopes can never be compared silently.  Basis: N4's
d02_bitwise_vs_n3 gate failed on state hashes while every d02 wrfout
frame was byte-identical to the N3 ratchet; a member-wise probe showed
exactly 1 of 288 canonical members differing -- the parent-duty staging
slot, zero-filled when d02 has no child and working memory when it
forces d03.  Its contents are a pure function of parent duty, rebuilt
every FORCE and rebuilt on restart, and physically inert to the owning
domain (287/288 members plus all output bytes identical).  Cross-shape
comparisons (ratchet state evidence, ancestor inertness, restart-split
sampling) use the trajectory scope; the full scope remains available
and every other member keeps full coverage.  Not a loosening: the
excluded member is enumerated, evidenced, and definitionally
shape-dependent bookkeeping.

AMENDED 2026-07-17 (F24, matched-reference completion and pre-convective
adjudication): MATCHED_REFERENCE_FRAMES now registers bundles per domain.
d02 retains the v1 frame pin (SHA-256 65fc6f52205c14cdf618ddf19520e8ae541e
c74a9188de45524f9c12e2fb04aa, 333839612 bytes); d03 and d04 use
gpuwm-wrf-matched-mp10-ysu-19740403-v2 (same build/physics, max_dom=4) at
13:15Z, pinned respectively to
SHA-256 4382b72ed3fa76662030f92e91ac97b3229e771b8dfce1b2351b58bd4ad25754
(383352328 bytes) and be32aa0b1b3b8b79e2d9f5748c8becc6fdd57e579185cdd819131388306622d6
(488452790 bytes).  An FSS family row is meteorologically degenerate when
either candidate or matched-reference event coverage on the registered
interior mask is below FSS_DEGENERATE_EVENT_FLOOR (1e-4); it is a
PROVISIONAL pass held for the registered ensemble-envelope adjudicator,
never a mechanical model failure at this valid time.  The adjudicator uses
at least three same-domain 13:15 ensemble members, records all pairwise FSS
values and their min/max envelope, and confirms degeneracy only when a
majority of members are themselves below the coverage floor.  Otherwise it
marks the held row revoked, and that revocation MUST re-open the consuming
rung.  Run provenance: the previously pinned serial wrf.exe (sha
f0fb585b...) cannot initialize the 601x601x50 d04 (RSL layer sizes a
broadcast buffer as signed 32-bit; ~2.23 GB request overflows) and is retired
for 4-domain work; matched v2 and the ensemble use the registered dmpar build
sha bda5e5e69754b5f5c7eb700ff20bb0e2bb65145f4e1beeef492e9b10edb586e5.

AMENDED 2026-07-18 (F27, ratified by the project owner after F25
adjudication: "yeah amend lets move forward"): the d03/d04 REFL_10CM FSS
20 dBZ rows convert from blocking to DOCUMENTED-DEFICIENCY records.  Basis:
four ensemble members (unperturbed, member-00/01/02 of
gpuwm-n5s-ensemble-v1) each score FSS20 0.8558 vs the matched v2 reference
at d03 13:15 (point envelope; one-ULP twins, zero spread); gpuwm scores
0.7047-0.7084 (stable across runs) — below the envelope minimum, a genuine
deficiency; mechanism identified as the residual ~0.87 hPa acoustic ringing
(mslp-ringing report; stabilization campaign staged). The registered 0.90
minimum is simultaneously established as miscalibrated (members miss it
too); the row's calibrated reference bar is the envelope minimum 0.8558.
When a future N4/N5 evaluation measures the row at or above the envelope
minimum 0.8558, the documented-deficiency conversion self-revokes and the
row returns to blocking at 0.8558.

AMENDED 2026-07-18 (F28, ratified by the project owner after the N5S
four-member scoring: "btw yes amend"): all three CPU twin-pairs scored
exactly 0.0 on all 61 registered metrics.  The one-ULP twins were output-
identical at the registered 15-min cadence throughout the 75 pre-convective
minutes, so every measured E95 envelope is degenerate-zero.  A metric's
envelope is DEGENERATE exactly when E95 == 0.  For any such row,
N5S_matched_physics_wrf_shadow converts from blocking to
DOCUMENTED-EVIDENCE under adjudication ``f28-degenerate-envelope``; the
measured GPU distance and zero envelope remain in the full evidence record
but the row does not fail the compound verdict.  RE-BINDING is automatic
and row-wise: metrics whose E95 > 0 remain binding under the registered
gpu_distance <= E95 comparator, and a future ensemble with non-degenerate
envelopes -- the staged Phase-6 convective-window extension -- restores full
binding force row-by-row.  No thresholds are altered; nothing is deleted.
The FP32-format-precision floor alternative was considered and rejected
because format floors (e.g. ~0.008 Pa for MU vs measured implementation-scale
differences of 1-2 hPa) are orders of magnitude below
implementation-difference scale — it would convert the degenerate gate into
a differently-unpassable one, not an honest bound.
