"""The nowcast score: how close an hour of forecast came to the radar.

A local DA window ends with a short forecast.  Until now its receipt counted
the observations the analysis accepted and said nothing at all about the
forecast, so the only way to answer "was it any good" was to look at the
pictures.  This module answers it with a number, using the instrument the
tree already has: the masked neighbourhood FSS of
:mod:`gpuwm.verify.obs.fss`, after Roberts and Lean (2008), against the MRMS
composite.

It is the same engine the free-forecast battery drives and deliberately not
the same registration.  The battery scores hours 2 to 18 of a free forecast
at four thresholds and four neighbourhoods; a nowcast lives inside the first
hour, where the leads are minutes, the useful neighbourhoods are small, and
50 dBZ at a 99 km box is a number nobody will read.  So the pins are their
own, they are hashed the same way, and the digest travels in the receipt.

**The persistence baseline is not optional here, and that is the point.**
In the first hour radar persistence -- the last scan, carried forward
unchanged -- is a genuinely strong forecast, and a model FSS published
beside nothing is unreadable: 0.6 is excellent against a persistence of 0.4
and a failure against a persistence of 0.7.  So every scored lead carries
the persistence score computed under the identical thresholds, boxes and
masks, and the difference model minus persistence for the primary scalar.
The persistence field is an OBSERVATION carried forward, not a model run, so
this is a baseline and not a reference-model control.

**Model and persistence are scored on identical cells.**  The shared
validity is the intersection of the lead scan's validity, the analysis
scan's validity and the model's finite mask, and both scores use it.  Score
them on different masks and the difference between them stops being skill
and starts being coverage.

**A lead that cannot be scored is never a zero.**  A lead whose valid time
has not arrived, or whose scan the archive has not published yet, is
``pending`` with a reason; a lead whose matching window holds no frame, or
none above the coverage floor, is ``missing-obs``; a lead the archive could
not be asked about at all -- no network -- is ``unavailable``, with the
error.  Each of those is a state a reader can act on.  A zero is a claim the
forecast put no echo where the radar saw one, and none of these is that.

    Three numbers and a state per lead: the model's primary scalar, the
    persistence baseline at the same lead, and the difference.  A reader who
    sees only this must still be able to tell a good forecast from one that
    lost to the last radar scan, which is why the baseline is in the compact
    form and not only in the full receipt.

    The two base rates travel with them for the same reason.  A box with no
    observed echo at the primary threshold scores FSS 1 against a model that
    also drew nothing, and its persistence baseline scores 1 as well, so the
    difference is 0 and the compact row reads exactly like a forecast that
    put the storms in the right place.  ``primary_observed_base_rate`` of
    0.0 is the fact that separates them, and dropping it here is what made
    the first fresh run on this build publish a perfect score for clear air
    on the status document, the execution report and the completion record
    at once.
