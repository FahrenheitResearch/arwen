"""The observation streams of the data assimilation (moved into the engine
from gpuwm-global ``arwen_global.obs_streams`` at b54373992587; the door rows it
needs are the engine's, :data:`gpuwm.obs.frontdoor.STREAM_DOORS`): what each is,
which Rust front door fetches and decodes it, how far behind real time it
arrives and in which latency class that puts it, how an hour's tables are
cut for the analysis under an information cutoff, and how the volumes are
recorded.

Design item 2 of the Arwen Global DA program (2026-09-06, with the design
amendments of 01:10 UTC).  Everything on the data path is Rust: the
fetchers, the decoders (GRIB through the mapped engine, NetCDF-4/HDF5
through netcrust and hdf5-reader, the fixed-width and CSV archives through
the ``rw-obs`` front doors) and the regridding.  This module is
orchestration: it names the streams, drives the binaries through
:mod:`gpuwm.obs.frontdoor`, cuts the decoded tables into analysis windows,
applies the information cutoff, thins to a stated grid when asked, and
writes the manifests.  Python decodes nothing here.

The interface every other lane reads
------------------------------------
* **The table.**  ``gpuwm-obs.table.v2``
  (:data:`gpuwm.obs.neutral_table.TABLE_HEADER`): one CSV row per
  observation, the ten v1 columns ``source, station_id, latitude_deg,
  longitude_deg, elevation_m, level_pa, valid_time, variable, value,
  error`` and the five bookkeeping columns ``measurement, nominal_time,
  published_time, received_time, revision``.  A surface row has an empty
  ``level_pa`` and is anchored at ``elevation_m``; an aloft row carries
  its pressure; a ``refractivity_n`` row is anchored at ``elevation_m``
  (the tangent height) and carries the retrieval's dry pressure in
  ``level_pa`` for the column gates only.  Times are ISO-8601 UTC with a
  ``Z``.  :func:`gpuwm.obs.neutral_table.load_obs` reads v2 and v1
  files (the neutral header is recognised before the declared source
  tables), so the engine's local data assimilation, gpuwm-global's cycle door and the
  ensemble filter's ``batches_from_rows`` take these files unchanged.
* **Observations at their own times.**  Every row keeps the instant it
  was measured (a METAR at 12:08 is a 12:08 row; a radiosonde level is at
  its release-plus-elapsed time with the nominal hour beside it in
  ``nominal_time``; a motion vector at its image mid-point).  An hourly
  cycle is a window, not an instant: :func:`cut_hours` writes the rows of
  ``(t - cycle/2, t + cycle/2]`` per analysis instant and never moves a
  row's time; the filter compares each report with the trajectory at the
  report's own time (the ensemble lane's contract).
* **The information cutoff.**  ``fresh`` returns the analysis constructible
  from information available by a declared cutoff, so
  :func:`apply_information_cutoff` keeps a row only when its
  ``received_time`` is at or before the cutoff; a row without a receipt
  time (decoded from files whose arrival was not recorded) is kept and
  counted as ``latency_unverified``, and the hours manifest says how many
  such rows each hour carries.  A historical case fetched days later is
  therefore labelled, never passed off as a real-time replay.
* **The variables** are :data:`gpuwm.obs.neutral_table.VARIABLE_TABLE`:
  ``surface_pressure_pa``, ``temperature_k``, ``dewpoint_k``,
  ``wind_u_m_s``, ``wind_v_m_s``, ``refractivity_n``.  A stream that wants
  a new one adds it there, with units and gross bounds, before any row is
  written; the ``measurement`` column
  (:data:`gpuwm.obs.neutral_table.MEASUREMENT_TABLE`) says which
  physical quantity a row is (a station pressure recovered from the
  altimeter setting, a sea-level pressure, a buoy wind reduced from 5 m).
* **The errors** are in every row (the Rust doors state them per stream
  and variable in their records; :data:`STREAMS` repeats them here).
* **Latency classes.**  Every stream carries a measured latency behind
  real time with its basis and a class (:data:`LATENCY_CLASSES`): ``fast``
  streams feed the hourly cycle, ``replay`` streams feed the delayed
  replay whose lag follows the measured latency, ``retrospective``
  streams exist only for past cases, ``gated`` sources need an account
  and are reported, never fetched.  The numbers are in the entries below
  with the date they were measured; :func:`stream_manifest` carries the
  measurement of each fetch.
* **Thinning.**  :func:`thin_to_grid` keeps one row per (source,
  variable, latitude band, longitude band, pressure layer) per window,
  the row nearest the analysis instant; the bands are the model grid's
  own spacing and the layer is ``ln p`` at ``layer_ln_p`` (default 0.1).
  It is a pre-thinning for a stated grid and is counted, never silent;
  the ensemble filter thins again to its own cell at analysis time (the
  ensemble lane's quality-control order), and the AMV door has already
  kept one vector per 0.5 degree box and 50 hPa layer.
* **The external analysis is not a stream.**  The GDAS or IFS analysis is
  a weak low-pass background constraint on the largest scales
  (:data:`ANCHOR_SOURCES`), because an external analysis already contains
  many of the observations assimilated here and offering it as millions of
  independent pseudo-reports would double-count them.  This module records
  the source, its cycle, its measured availability latency and the
  mapping row that reads it; the analysis lanes implement the constraint
  and record its increment separately.  It constrains selected scales only
  and is never claimed to make the cycle unable to drift.
* **The manifest** of a fetched stream (``gpuwm-obs.stream.v2``) wraps the
  door's own fetch and table records: URLs, bytes, SHA-256 per source
  file, rows per variable and per hour, the QC counters, and the latency
  behind real time with its basis and class.

Streams (:data:`STREAMS`)
-------------------------
``iem-metar``  worldwide METAR through the Iowa Environmental Mesonet ASOS
archive (266 networks, hourly), ``rw_asos networks``, ``rw_asos fetch
--networks`` and ``rw_asos table``: station pressure from the altimeter
setting, 2 m temperature and dewpoint, 10 m wind.  ``igra2`` the NCEI
IGRA2 year-to-date archive, ``rw_igra2``: every pressure level's
temperature, dewpoint and wind at its own time and the surface level's
pressure.  ``goes-dmw`` GOES-18 and GOES-19 ABI L2 derived motion winds,
``rw_amv``: u and v at the assigned pressure, DQF gated, zenith screened,
thinned.  ``ndbc`` NDBC buoys and coastal stations, ``rw_ndbc``.
``cdaac-ro`` the UCAR CDAAC near-real-time occultation retrievals
(COSMIC-2, PAZ, KOMPSAT-5), ``rw_gnssro cdaac-fetch`` and ``table
--tarballs``: one daily tarball per mission, anonymous, published about
five hours after the day it covers ends (the delayed-replay class), the
refractivity at tangent heights with the retrieval's dry pressure for the
ln p metric; ``gnss-ro`` the AWS ``gnss-ro-data`` archive, ``rw_gnssro
list/fetch/table --files``: the same rows for past cases (the bucket holds
nothing after 2025-07-29).  ``wis2`` the WMO Information System 2 global
broker and caches, ``rw_wis2``: the notification stream subscribed over
MQTT, every original message archived on receipt, the coverage and
latency measured; the BUFR payloads are archived and counted and are not
yet decoded into the table (a named open item).  ``awc-metar`` the
Aviation Weather Center METAR cache as the complementary surface source,
``rw_asos awc``.  ``madis-acars``, ``madis-raob`` and ``madis-mesonet`` the
NOAA MADIS public files (commercial aircraft, radiosondes worldwide, the
public part of the mesonet collection), ``rw_madis fetch/table``: anonymous,
from the real-time directory (about five and a half days, each hour file
rewritten while its reports arrive) and the dated archive behind it, MADIS's
own QC summary applied and GSI's regional error table per row.  An earlier
version of this table called MADIS account-gated; the public files never
were (the account covers the restricted providers, which are absent from the
public files by MADIS policy).

No stream here needs an account.  Reachable but not decoded here: the NWS
upper-air text feed (FM-35 TEMP parts, US sites, about three minutes
behind the nominal hour); IGRA2 covers the same soundings a day later and
is the sounding stream of record until a TEMP decoder exists.

The door's streams (:func:`fetch_stream`) are what ``gpuwm obs streams
fetch`` runs and what the DA door's ``--stream NAME`` fetches per window
(gpuwm-global's ``da_streams`` and the engine's local data assimilation): one function, two callers, so the
cycle and the command line cannot drift.
