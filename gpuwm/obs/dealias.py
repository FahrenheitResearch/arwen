"""Region-based velocity dealiasing that abstains instead of guessing.

Radial velocity from a pulsed Doppler radar is a phase measurement, so it is
only known modulo the Nyquist interval ``2 * Vn``.  A true ``+40 m/s`` on a
cut whose Nyquist is ``25.51 m/s`` is reported as ``-11.02 m/s``: finite,
plausible, smooth, and wrong by ``51.02 m/s``.  :mod:`gpuwm.obs.superob`
answers that today by masking -- it drops every gate above
``nyquist_reject_fraction`` of Nyquist and counts the loss -- which is safe
and which, on a cut whose Nyquist is 25.51, caps the assimilable wind at
20.4 m/s.  A mesocyclone's rotational couplet is a pair of strong,
opposite-signed low-level velocities; the mask removes it, and removes more
of it the stronger the storm gets.

This module recovers those gates by unfolding them, and it is built around
one rule: **where the unfolding is ambiguous the gate is rejected, not
guessed.**  A confidently wrong dealiased velocity is worse than a missing
one, because a missing one is a mask the filter never sees and a wrong one
enters the filter with a 1-2 m/s observation error attached to a 51 m/s
mistake.

Method
------
Region-based unfolding, the standard approach, with one volume-scale step
in front of it:

0. **Profile.**  Before any sweep is unfolded, a single ``u(z), v(z)`` is
   built from the whole volume: every range band of every velocity cut is
   fitted, converted to a wind, and pooled onto a height grid where the
   median is taken.  A volume reaches most heights several times over -- 4 km
   sits at 60 km range on a 4-degree cut and at 200 km on a 1-degree one --
   and a layer is believed only when cuts at two or more *different*
   elevations reached it and it is continuous with the layers around it.
   This is the only cross-check available without an external model field,
   and it is what stops a sparse far-range band from anchoring thousands of
   gates to a wind no other sweep saw.
1. **Segment.**  Two range- or azimuth-adjacent gates join the same region
   when both are finite and differ by at most
   ``region_join_fraction * Vn``.  A fold between neighbours produces a jump
   of very nearly ``2 * Vn``, so at the 0.5 default a fold can never occur
   *inside* a region unless the true gate-to-gate shear exceeds ``1.5 * Vn``
   (38 m/s across one 250 m gate here), which no atmosphere produces.  That
   bound is the assumption this stage rests on and it is stated so it can be
   argued with.
2. **Vote.**  Every adjacent gate pair that did *not* join contributes an
   integer vote ``f = round((v_lo - v_hi) / (2 * Vn))`` to the edge between
   the two regions it spans, meaning "region *hi* sits ``f`` Nyquist
   intervals above region *lo*".
3. **Anchor.**  An environmental reference -- a fold-aware VAD fitted to the
   sweep itself (Browning & Wexler 1968), or an externally supplied
   background wind profile -- pins whole regions to an absolute fold count.
   Only regions that look *environmental* after unfolding may anchor: the
   median residual against the reference must be small, which a rotational
   couplet's region will fail, so a couplet is never forced onto the
   background wind.
4. **Grow.**  From each anchor, unresolved regions are resolved across their
   strongest confident edge first.  An edge is confident only when it has
   enough boundary pairs, a large enough winning-vote majority, and a mean
   jump close enough to an integer.
5. **Verify, then abstain.**  Every confident edge between two resolved
   regions must agree with the assignment; regions on a violated edge are
   rejected.  Regions never anchored and never reached are rejected.  Gates
   whose unfolded speed leaves the physical bound are rejected, and so are
   gates that depart from the reference by more than a couplet could -- a
   fold error displaces a gate by a whole Nyquist interval, 51 m/s on the
   tilts that matter here, while the physical departures this must not touch
   are smaller.

Every velocity gate therefore ends in exactly one of three states --
:data:`STATE_UNFOLDED`, :data:`STATE_UNCHANGED`, :data:`STATE_REJECTED` --
and all three are counted, per sweep and per volume, with a reason recorded
for every rejection.

Relationship to BowEcho
-----------------------
Drew's Rust radar stack (BowEcho, ``crates/render2d``) already carries four
dealiasing engines, and steps 1-2 here are deliberately the same algorithm
and the same constants as its shared ``region_core`` -- ``REGION_JOIN_FRAC``
0.5, ``REGION_MAX_FOLD`` 5, the same vote convention, the same
strongest-boundary-first resolution order, the same range-band harmonic
reference geometry (``REFERENCE_BAND_GATES`` 16, 48 samples, 5 of 12
azimuth sectors, 12 m/s trim).

Steps 3-5 are where this diverges, and the divergence is the point.
BowEcho's v1 engine anchors *the largest region in each connected group to
fold 0* and always assigns a fold to every region: correct for a display,
where an unresolved region is a visual artifact a human discounts, and
wrong for assimilation, where it is a confident number the filter believes.
This module refuses to assign a fold it cannot justify.

The ingest boundary is why this is Python at all.  ``rw-nexrad`` -- the
mandated ingest crate -- is a binary-only crate with no ``lib.rs`` and no
Python binding, and BowEcho's engines consume ``radar_core::RadarVolume``
while ``rw-nexrad`` emits flat ``<f4`` planes; the two Rust trees share no
crate today.  :func:`dealias_sweep` is therefore written against exactly
what crosses that seam -- a ``(radial, gate)`` plane, an azimuth vector, one
Nyquist scalar -- so that when the plumbing exists it is replaced by a call,
not by a rewrite.

Engines
-------
That call now exists.  :mod:`gpuwm.obs.dealias_region` drives Drew's Rust
``region-global-dealias`` crate -- a port of Py-ART's
``dealias_region_based`` -- through a C ABI, and
:attr:`DealiasParams.engine` selects between them:

``"region-global"`` (the default)
    The Rust crate.  It unfolds the whole region network jointly rather
    than growing outward from anchors, carries no environmental reference,
    and assigns a fold to every region it resolved instead of abstaining.
    Its refinement pass runs by default with it.
``"vad-region"``
    Everything described above: VAD-anchored, and it abstains.  Selectable
    and supported; it is what every run before 2026-08-12 read.

The two engines are *different algorithms* and their gate decisions differ
by design; the shared contract is the three-state result, the one physical
bound of :func:`speed_bounded`, and their accounting -- not the decisions.
``engine`` is a recorded parameter -- it travels into provenance with the
velocities it produced -- because "which solver said this wind was 40 m/s"
is not an implementation detail to anyone reading an assimilated field
back.

The default changed with measurement in hand, not with the newest engine:
on one real 14-cut volume the abstainer rejected both gates of a 98 m/s
couplet as unresolved and the region-global engine recovered them, at
0.3 percent of the dealias stage's wall clock.  Because that decision
moves which velocities reach the filter on every run that asks for
dealiasing, the library the default now needs is a BLOCKING check in
``gpuwm doctor`` rather than an optional one.

    every folded gate toward a wind that is wrong by a Nyquist interval.

    The alternation has local minima -- a fit sitting one interval off
    explains its own folds perfectly -- so it is run from several seeds and
    the one with the lowest *wrapped* cost wins.  The wrapped cost is
    periodic in ``2 * Vn`` by construction, so it cannot prefer a solution
    merely for being folded.

    Returns ``(a, b, residual_rms, inliers)`` or None when the band does not
    qualify.

    ``velocity`` is ``(radial, gate)`` raw radial velocity with NaN for no
    data; ``nyquist`` is the sweep's Nyquist velocity, or None when the sweep
    reports none -- in which case nothing here is knowable and every finite
    gate is rejected with :data:`REASON_NO_NYQUIST`, which is the same
    refusal :mod:`gpuwm.obs.superob` already makes.  Both engines make that
    same refusal, so a caller cannot change it by changing solver.

    ``reference`` is an optional externally supplied ``(radial, gate)``
    environmental field -- e.g. :meth:`WindProfile.radial_reference` on the
    model background.  When given it seeds the fit and then *supplements* the
    VAD: bands the VAD could not fit fall back to it, so a sweep too
    storm-filled to fit a wind profile still has something to anchor
    against.  It is consumed by ``"vad-region"`` only; the region-global
    engine carries no environmental reference at all, and is handed none
    rather than being handed one it would ignore.

    ``first_gate_m`` and ``gate_spacing_m`` are the sweep's physical range
    geometry.  They are needed only by the region-global refinement pass,
    which fits a wrapped vortex in real space and cannot do that on gate
    indices.
