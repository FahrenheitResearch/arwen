"""A runtime interlock that makes the import constraint structural.

The forecast worker must import ``gpuwm`` only from the Arwen checkout
the port pins.  Relying on nobody ever typing ``from gpuwm.cycle.anchor
import read_anchor`` inside the worker is not a constraint, it is a
hope; the first contributor who needs an anchor helper will type it, the
port will refuse eight frames deep inside ``_construct_device_stack``
with a message about frozen Arwen, and whoever debugs that will lose an
evening.

So the worker installs this guard on ``sys.meta_path`` before it touches
anything, and the guard refuses the import at the point of the import,
naming the bridge and the reason.  Two rules:

``gpuwm.cycle`` and everything under it is refused ALWAYS.
    The spine namespace can never legitimately appear in a forecast
    process.  The pinned Arwen checkout is a frozen v2 tree whose
    manifest is entirely ``gpuwm/core/...``; it has no cycling spine.  So
    any resolution of ``gpuwm.cycle`` is by definition a resolution
    against the live spine tree, which is the exact thing the port
    refuses -- only here it is refused early and legibly.

``gpuwm`` itself is refused until the guard is ARMED with a pinned root.
    Arming is the worker saying "this checkout, and only this one".
    After arming, :func:`verify_pinned` re-reads
    ``sys.modules['gpuwm'].__file__`` and confirms it really did land
    under the pinned root.  That check is recorded in the worker's
    receipt, so the evidence that the constraint held travels with the
    run instead of being asserted in prose.
