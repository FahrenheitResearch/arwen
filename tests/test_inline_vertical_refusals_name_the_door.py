"""The inline vertical refusals must name the route that DOES work.

A per-domain vertical ladder ships on the offline downscale route.  The
inline nest corridor still shares one ladder across a live tree and its
refusals stand -- but a refusal that says only "not implemented" now
describes the product as less capable than it is, and the reader it turns
away has a working door two lines from the one they knocked on.

This is the retire-its-guards half of the gate law: the guards survive
because the breakage they name is real, and their WORDING is what the fix
retires.
