"""The ArWen moist LES case, validated against the banked WRF oracle.

CPU-only, and deliberately so: every claim here is checkable before any
ArWen moist run exists, which is the order the P1 instrument-honesty rule
requires (``tools/wrf_em_les_oracle/INSTRUMENT-HISTORY.md``).

Three things are pinned.

**The initial condition.** The case rebuilds the ratified capped-moist
``input_sounding`` from committed constants; its sha256 must be
``993fedb1...``, the asset the oracle campaign actually ran, and the
capped-dry anchor and the base dry asset must come out of the same
constructor at their own committed hashes.  A case that initialises from
a re-derivation of the reference sounding is not running the reference
case.

**The reduction.** ``cloud_topped_boundary_layer.reduce_moist_profiles``
is a transcription of the oracle's ``same_instrument_moist.reduce_moist``.
Transcriptions rot.  These tests run both routines on the four banked
oracle fixtures and require *bit* equality on every scalar, and separately
require the transcription to reproduce the numbers the oracle published in
its own receipt JSONs.  The load-bearing case is ``zi_thetav_load_m``:
one name, two heights (cloud base in a cloudy run, the inversion in a
clear one), so a drift here would silently compare two different
quantities.

**The npz contract.** The writer must emit every array the reducer
requires, at the documented shapes, with the SGS carrier present only
where it exists.
