"""One extractor, one door registry, for every docs-to-code binding.

There were three partial implementations of the same idea in this tree
before this module existed, each correct and each blind to what the
others saw:

* ``test_verification_recipe_flags.py`` extracts the fenced block under
  VERIFICATION.md's reproduce heading and feeds each command to the
  parser that would receive it.  Strongest check, narrowest scope: one
  section of one document.
* ``test_certify_verdict.py`` binds CERTIFICATION.md's condition table
  to the ``CONDITIONS`` the code declares, in the direction
  docs-must-match-code.
* ``test_docs_extras_agree_with_code.py`` holds every documented install
  line against the extras ``pyproject.toml`` declares, in both
  directions.

They agree on the shape -- read a document, read the code, hold the two
against each other -- and disagreed on the mechanism, so a fourth was
not wanted.

There are two BINDING KINDS in play, and it is worth being exact about
which one this module serves, because putting them in one abstraction
would help nobody:

* **Command bindings** -- a document tells a reader to RUN something,
  and the parser is the authority on what runs.  This module is that
  mechanism: the door registry, the fragment reader, and the resolver
  that decides whether a piece of a document is a command at all.  Its
  consumers are ``test_docs_extras_agree_with_code.py`` (every
  user-facing page, membership) and ``test_verification_recipe_flags.py``
  (one recipe, full ``parse_args``).  A consumer may be as strict as it
  likes on top of the shared floor; the recipe's parse catches a missing
  required argument that membership cannot, and the two are asserted to
  resolve the same door from the same registry.
* **Enumeration bindings** -- the code declares a SET and a document
  presents a table of it as complete.  ``test_certify_verdict.py``'s
  condition table and this file's consumers' ``[case_data]`` key rules
  are both of that kind: read the set from the code, read the table from
  the page, compare.  They need no extractor and deliberately do not
  import one.

A new binding belongs in whichever of those two it is.  A new
mechanism needs a reason neither covers.
