"""The observation battery's run routes, asked the same way the campaign asks.

Two tools are under test and one committed receipt:

* ``tools/battery_route_preflight.py`` -- every static admission gate on the
  HRRR run route, answered for one experiment config before anything is
  fetched.  Its value is that it calls the route's OWN gate functions, so
  these tests pin the answers rather than a restatement of the rules; the
  day a gate changes, the receipt these tests read changes with it and the
  assertions about WHICH gate answered still hold.
* ``tools/battery_wrf_node_plan.py`` -- the WRF node bundle, generated from
  the same config so the two model arms cannot drift apart in physics.
* ``docs/public/receipts/obsbattery/B4-SPEED-ANCHORS.json`` -- the speed
  anchors every compute projection is arithmetic over.  The committed
  anchor entry is checked against the run report it cites, which is what
  keeps the receipt from becoming folklore.
