"""GOCART sea-salt emission (seas_opt=1) against WRF v4.7.1, bit for bit.

``run_gocart_seasalt.F90`` drives the byte-unmodified
``gocart_seasalt_driver`` / ``source_ss`` (chem/module_gocart_seasalt.F) over
open ocean at 10 m winds 0, 3, 10 and 25 m s-1, an elevated lake (no
emission, since WRF requires z_at_w < 1 mm), land, thin lowest layers and dt
30 and 60 s, three consecutive steps.  The port computes source_ss's per
sub-bin mass factor once per dt in a one-thread table kernel with the same
operation sequence and sums it per column in WRF's sub-bin order.

Measured on the node-1 RTX 4090 (sm_89): every sea-salt mixing ratio and
EMIS_SEAS equals the Fortran bit for bit.  Made to fire before commit:
module_data_gocart_seas.F's ``pi = 3.141592653559`` is a float32 literal in a
REAL*8 PARAMETER; using the double pi instead fails the test.
