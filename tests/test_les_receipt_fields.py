"""The LES receipt's determinism-screen field partition.

CPU-only.  The dual-run screen for the CBL receipts is documented as
"compare every numeric receipt field, excluding wall-clock timings"
(docs/superpowers/receipts/les/ARWEN-REALISATION-SPREAD.md §1).  The
sm_89 stress lane falsified that phrasing on a shared card: two
same-seed reps were byte-identical in every other field and differed
ONLY in ``vram_gib`` (0.72 vs 1.60 GiB), because that figure was
device-wide occupancy ((total - free) from ``cudaMemGetInfo``) and a
forecast co-tenanted the card.  A screen whose field set contains an
environment measurement false-positives on healthy runs.

The receipt therefore says, in code, which of its fields are properties
of the run (screened -- the corruption-detection surface) and which are
properties of the machine at the moment of measurement (environmental
-- excluded).  These tests pin that partition: it must be exhaustive
and disjoint over real committed receipts, the environmental side must
own every timing and every device-wide memory name past and present,
and the per-process pool figure must stay on the screened side.
