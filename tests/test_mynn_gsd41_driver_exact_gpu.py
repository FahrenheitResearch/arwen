"""The CUDA gsd_41 MYNN driver against the operational fork's own driver.

``bl_mynn_version = "gsd_41"`` against NOAA-EMC/HRRR v4.1.21
``module_bl_mynn.F`` ``mynn_bl_driver`` (gfortran 13.3.0 -O0, glibc 2.39),
HRRR's namelist identity, over the six column families of the WRF v4.6.1
families oracle, twelve 20 s steps (tests/_mynn_families_gsd41.py).

* With the fork's own forms -- ``bl_mynn_cloud_tendency_form = "gsd_41"``,
  and ``bl_mynn_gsd41_unsquared_qtke`` matching the build (the unmodified
  file, or the one :995 line squared) -- every output of every step is the
  fork's word, step by step from the recorded inputs and free-running from
  the cold start.
* The default ``bl_mynn_cloud_tendency_form = "wrf_461"`` replaces the fork's
  two defects in its cloud-water tendencies (P13/P22 of docs/dev/mynn-gsd41.md:
  heat from the pre-mixing condensate, and negative condensate clipped in the
  tendency, which creates water).  Step by step, only the theta and vapour
  tendency values may differ from the fork. The cloud-water tendency can also
  change a zero sign when the corrected clipping path is used; its nonzero
  values and all other output words must still agree.

lane/mynn-exact made this exact: the fork's mym_level2 and mym_turbulence
divide by a2den where v4.6.1 multiplies by a2fac; its thetav is
th*(1+0.608*sqv); its cpm reads the mixing ratio it was handed; and the unit
runs WOOF's own float32 elementary functions with no FMA contraction.
