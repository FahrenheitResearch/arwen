"""The endpoint ladder: which rung is asked, and which one moves bytes.

Every NCEP source publishes on two hosts that serve byte-identical
objects under byte-identical keys.  They differ in three ways, and all
three are table facts here: the operational server publishes hours
earlier, it keeps a bounded window, and it paces bulk transfers where
the archive does not.  So the router resolves the concrete cycle, takes
the endpoints whose retention covers that cycle's age -- and then, for
the transfer itself, prefers the throughput rung for any object the
mirror has already caught up with.

No network anywhere in this file -- the selection function, the
availability probe and the transfer's ladder walk are all driven
directly.
