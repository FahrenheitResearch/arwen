"""The region-global engine: the selector, the handshake, the refusal.

The solver itself is Drew's vendored crate and is tested by its own Rust
suite (``cargo test`` in ``tools/region_global_dealias``) and, on real
sweeps, against Py-ART itself -- see
``evidence/dealias-region/pyart-parity.json``.  What is tested here is the
part this tree owns: that ``engine`` selects, that the ABI is checked
before a solve rather than after, that a missing library is a named
refusal rather than a traceback, and that the result honours the same
three-state contract the VAD engine does.
