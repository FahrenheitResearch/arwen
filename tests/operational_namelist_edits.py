"""The operational HRRR namelist as tests import it since 2026-10-12.

Three decisions of the namelist door changed what NOAA's own namelist
(NOAA-EMC/HRRR v4.1.21 ``parm/conus/hrrr_wrf.nl``) becomes:

* its HRRR-Smoke chemistry (``chem_opt = 18``) is no longer imported to
  run with none.  It maps onto ArWen's ``smoke`` set, and the four smoke
  settings ArWen does not carry are refused by name
  (tests/test_operational_namelist_door.py pins that refusal).  A test
  that is about something else in that namelist imports it through
  :func:`importable`, which changes exactly those four settings and
  ``hailcast_opt`` (next point).
* its ``hailcast_opt = 1`` is refused by name (ArWen does not run
  WRF-HAILCAST on this line; it feeds nothing back, so 0 changes no
  forecast field).  :func:`importable` writes 0, as does
  :func:`without_smoke`.
* the namelist omits ``&dynamics top_lid``, which now imports as WRF's
  open top instead of the profile's rigid lid.  A control pinned to the
  bytes or the hash of an earlier import reads the one lid line through
  :func:`with_parent_lid` / :func:`as_open_top`.
