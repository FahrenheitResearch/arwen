"""``gpuwm-obs.radar-grid.v1``: round-trip, identity binding, and refusals.

The schema is a cross-lane contract, so the tests are about what a DA lane
can rely on: that every named variable survives a write/read cycle
bit-for-bit at float32, that the file is welded to a grid identity, and
that a mismatch is an exception rather than a silent regrid.

The synthetic volume here is built in memory rather than decoded from a
Level-II file, so the superob arithmetic is checked against numbers that
can be worked out by hand: one radar, a handful of gates, known dBZ and
known velocities.
