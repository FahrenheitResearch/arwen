"""Superobbing an ODIM pack: the clear-air regime, and the silent-empty refusal.

The cross-lane proof — a real KNMI Den Helder volume through the real
``rw_odim`` writer, through this stage, onto a real wrfout — is recorded in
``Downloads/intl-da-odim/front-door.md``. It needs a 26 MB volume off a
24-hour feed and a 700 MB wrfout, so it cannot live in the suite. What lives
here is what would otherwise be exercised only by that file.

The refusal in :func:`test_a_volume_that_yields_no_gate_is_refused` is not
hypothetical and is why this file exists. ``rw_odim`` wrote ODIM's own
``DBZH``/``VRADH`` moment names where :mod:`gpuwm.obs.superob` filters for
``REF``/``VEL``; every one of 8.5 million gates was skipped, ``sweeps_used``
still counted fifteen, the observation file wrote successfully, and its record
was entirely zeros. Nothing failed. There was simply nothing in it.

The grid here is a stub rather than a real :class:`~gpuwm.obs.target_grid.
TargetGrid`, because a TargetGrid is built from a wrfout and none of these
tests is about geometry. Everything they assert — the census, the vocabulary,
the refusal — is settled per gate, before or independently of where the gate
lands.
