#: DECLARED DIVERGENCE, (advance_w, default): the default build's advance_w
#: is not WRF's operation order.  Its default-arm WRF order was dropped at
#: integration (f66a15240, "Drop unqualified default acoustic arm": it failed
#: the real-column exactness gate), so a default acoustic launch keeps its
#: published arithmetic, gpuwm.core.kernels.diffusion_kernel answers False
#: for the acoustic unit, and tests/assembled_legacy_proofs.py::
#: validate_published_acoustic pins that arithmetic's own words.  Against
#: WRF 4.6.1's advance_w on the upper-damping fixture it differs in this
#: many of its 153,600 words, measured per compute capability after the
#: damp_opt=3 coefficient took WRF's float32 product in the default build
#: (117,651 before it): sm_89 on the RTX 4090 (node-1), sm_120 on the RTX
#: 5070 Ti (node-4).  The count is the card's: NVRTC contracts the default
#: arithmetic per architecture.  The arm asserts the declared count rather
#: than dropping out, so a change in either direction means the default
#: acoustic arithmetic moved and must be declared again; the strict arm
#: holds 0 on every card.  A capability with no declared count still has
#: to show a partial divergence over the whole fixture, and prints its
#: count for declaring.
