"""``tools/import_sweep.py`` imports the package and tells an absence from a fault.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS
--------------------------
xc-06-01 of the 2026-09 audit: `.github/workflows/` held one workflow, whose
``test`` job names 17 test files by hand.  Resolving every ``gpuwm.*`` import
in those 17 files and taking the module-scope transitive closure reaches 221
of 525 package modules -- 209,243 of 433,411 lines.  The other half of the
package was never IMPORTED by anything an automated gate ran, so a
``SyntaxError``, a bad module-scope constant or a broken internal import
there produced a green check on the pull request.

The sweep answers that in seconds with no GPU and no fixtures.  What makes it
a gate rather than a smoke test is the distinction this file exercises: a
``ModuleNotFoundError`` for a DECLARED extra is tolerated and reported, and
everything else -- including a ``ModuleNotFoundError`` for a ``gpuwm.*``
name, which is a broken internal import wearing the same exception class --
fails.  An opportunistic ``except Exception: continue`` walk (the shape
``tests/test_doctor.py:1031-1035`` uses, correctly, for a different question)
would pass on a package that ships entirely broken.

The second breakage, found by review of the first fix: the walk caught
``Exception``, so one module's import-scope ``sys.exit()`` ended the whole
sweep with that module's status and no report -- measured as exit 2 and no
output on a box with a visible CUDA device.  A gate that the thing it
measures can terminate is worse than a narrow one, because a narrow gate at
least prints what it did check.
