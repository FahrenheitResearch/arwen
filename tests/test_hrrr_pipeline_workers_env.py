"""GPUWM_PIPELINE_WORKERS overrides the HRRR decoder worker count without
breaking the preparation's receipt check.

Breakage it prevents (Vast V8X, 2026-10-27): the override rewrote the
receipt's "requested" to the environment value, so
prepare_hrrr_wrf._validated_worker_receipts (which compares "requested" with
the count it passed) refused every preparation after ~10 min with
"HRRR decoder worker receipt is malformed".
