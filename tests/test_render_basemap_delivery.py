"""The renderer's map assets must arrive with the renderer that reads them.

``rw_wrfbatch`` draws coastlines, national and state borders, lakes and
counties from the Natural Earth + US Census shapefiles in
``tools/rustwx/assets/basemap``.  Those shapefiles reached a pip install
by no mechanism at all: the wheel declared ``tools =
["prepare_hrrr_*.sh"]`` and nothing else, and the bundle carried eight
binaries and no data.  The result was not an error -- it was a plot.  A
tropical cyclone rendered over a blank white rectangle, with nothing on
the image to say where on Earth it was, produced by a lane running the
published wheel exactly as documented.

The bug survived because the machine it was developed on hides it:
``rustwx-render`` falls back to a **cartopy** Natural Earth cache under
``$HOME/.local/share/cartopy``, and a workstation that has ever run
cartopy has one.  Every test in this file therefore either avoids the
renderer's own fallbacks entirely or redirects ``HOME``/``USERPROFILE``
away from them, and the end-to-end proof runs against an installed
wheel with the repository nowhere on the path.

Why the bundle and not the wheel
--------------------------------
Measured, not assumed: the wheel is 74.6 MiB compressed against PyPI's
100 MB per-file cap, and the asset tree deflates to 20.2 MiB.  Shipping
the shapefiles in the wheel leaves roughly half a megabyte of headroom
before an upload starts being rejected, which is not a margin a release
can be run on -- ``MANIFEST.in`` already externalizes the two largest
Thompson tables for exactly this reason.  The bundle has room, and it is
where the consuming binary already is: staged under
``<dest>/assets/basemap``, the shapefiles sit on the resolution ladder
``rw_wrfbatch`` already walks (``assets/basemap`` under the first eight
ancestors of its own directory), so the binary finds them with no
environment variable set and no cooperation from the Python half.

And why the companion as well
-----------------------------
The bundle is ``gpuwm fetch-bridges``'s, and once the platform wheels
carried the renderer themselves nothing ran that command: neither the
README's Linux steps nor the Linux package's INSTALL.md.  Every picture
of a wheel install came out with no coastlines, borders or state lines,
and the one warning went to a stderr the run captured and dropped.  The
``gpuwm-data`` companion is a hard dependency every install pulls and is
not size-bound the way the ``gpuwm`` wheel is, so since 2.8.0 it carries
the renderer's three layer directories and ``gpuwm.rustwx`` hands them to
the renderer; a run whose renderer still has none says so in a
``render_basemap_missing`` event.  The tests at the end of this file pin
both halves.
