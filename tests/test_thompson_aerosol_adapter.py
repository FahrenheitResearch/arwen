"""Composition gates for the ``mp_physics=28`` forecast adapter (WP-09).

Every kernel this adapter calls was gated by its own package against the
Fortran oracle before the adapter existed.  Those gates are necessary and not
sufficient: a package can reproduce its own block exactly and still be wired
into the call graph wrongly.  This module owns the five properties that only
the composition can have, plus the end-to-end oracle gate (G3).

WHAT IS PINNED HERE, AND WHY EACH IS INVISIBLE TO A UNIT TEST
------------------------------------------------------------
1. ACCUMULATOR ZEROING.  ``ncten``/``nwfaten``/``nifaten`` live in persistent
   ``state.scratch`` slots that survive across steps by design
   (``gpuwm/core/state.py:710-735``).  A unit test allocates a fresh zeroed
   array for every call and therefore *cannot* observe a missing ``fill(0)``.
   ``test_accumulators_are_zeroed_at_entry_not_carried_between_calls`` poisons
   the three slots between two otherwise identical calls on real device
   kernels and requires bit-identical output.

2. WARM/COLD ENTRY-MASK DISJOINTNESS.  Both kernel headers assert their gates
   are exact complements
   (``thompson_aerosol_warm.cu:68-82``, ``thompson_aerosol_cold.cu:311``).
   That is only true if the warm mask is captured on the ENTRY temperature.
   The cold network writes latent heating in place, so capturing the mask
   after it lets a cell it heated across 0 C run BOTH halves, double-counting
   ``pnc_wau``/``pnc_rcw``/``pna_rca``/``pnd_rcd``.  Neither kernel can see
   this; only the adapter's statement order decides it.

3. LAUNCH ORDER.  The ``ncten`` balance limiter (:2996-3019) is a standalone
   launch precisely so it can run ONCE, between the warm network and the
   saturation adjustment.  Surface emission must follow the terminal apply
   (mp_gt_driver:1310-1327) and is deliberately unclamped.  Both are pure
   sequencing facts.

4. NO COOPER.  mp=28 SUBSTITUTES ``iceDeMott`` for Cooper nucleation
   (:2537-2551 selects one or the other on ``is_aerosol_aware``).  Launching a
   Cooper-bearing classic kernel would ADD a second ice source; the result
   stays finite and plausible.  This is pinned at the launcher level AND at
   the CUDA-symbol level, by recording every ``get_kernel`` request a real
   device call makes -- on a not-due call AND on a reflectivity-due one,
   which is the path the G3 gate itself runs.

5. WHICH DENSITY FEEDS WHICH KERNEL.  WRF carries TWO air densities across
   the condensation seam and uses both: :3242-3243 builds the working rain
   moments from the :3193 (pre-condensation) density while :3505-3520 reads
   the :3490 (post-condensation) one.  Every kernel involved exposes exactly
   what it needs, so only the adapter's wiring can get this wrong, and
   getting it wrong scales rain evaporation by ``rho_post/rho_pre``.  No
   unit test can see it; it was worth 1.9e-03 on aero-reduces-to-classic
   until WP-12a, and it was the port's ONLY carved-out end-to-end tolerance.

WHAT THE END-TO-END GATE COMPARES (WP-12a widened it)
------------------------------------------------------
Twenty-three quantities per fixture: the 15 prognostic column fields, the
SEVEN surface diagnostics WRF's driver writes at mp_gt_driver:1298-1308, and
the ``refl_dbz`` column unmodified WRF ``calc_refl10cm`` produced.  Before
WP-12a it compared the 15 column fields and RAINNC and nothing else, so
``snownc``/``snowncv``/``graupelnc``/``graupelncv``/``sr`` and every dBZ in
the deck -- up to 51.98 -- were unmeasured by this gate.  Widening it found a
live defect in the SR expression immediately, and
:func:`test_the_g3_gate_leaves_no_fixture_column_uncompared` now derives the
coverage claim from the fixtures' own CSV headers so it cannot silently
shrink again.

The host gates (1-4 at the call-graph level, plus the guards and the scratch
registry agreement) run with NO GPU: they drive the real adapter over a
NumPy-backed state with recording launchers, exactly as
``tests/test_thompson_adapter_composition.py`` does for mp=8.  The device
gates import cupy inside the test function so ``conftest``'s AST marker keeps
the host gates unmarked.

THE ORACLE HARNESS AND ITS ENTRY-STATE RECONSTRUCTION
-----------------------------------------------------
``_apply_thompson_aerosol`` derives temperature and layer depth from the
prognostic state exactly as mp=8 does::

    th   = thb + thp
    pii  = (p/P0)**RCP
    T    = th * pii
    z8w  = (phb + php)/G ;  dz = z8w[1:] - z8w[:-1]

so driving it from a column fixture means solving for ``thp`` and ``php``
whose float32 round trip reproduces the fixture's ``temp_k`` and ``dz_m``
BIT-EXACTLY.  That is not pedantry: the sed package measured that a
one-float32-ulp shift in the saturation fit flips ``module_mp_thompson.F``'s
``ssatw > 1.E-15`` condensation gate (:3401, eps at :185) at every cloud-free
level of a saturated column.  A one-ulp temperature error is a ~20-ulp
``qvs`` error and would do the same, so an approximate reconstruction would
make the whole G3 measurement meaningless.

:func:`_reconstruct_entry_state` therefore searches:

* a base height offset ``z0`` such that every ``z8w`` level is in the image
  of ``phi -> float32(phi/G)`` and every float32 difference equals the
  fixture's ``dz`` exactly -- measured: all 22 fixtures solve, ``dz`` exact;
* per level, a ``thp`` with ``float32(thp*pii) == temp_k`` exactly, allowing
  the pressure to move by a few float32 ulps only where no ``thp`` exists at
  the fixture pressure.

The pressure perturbation is REPORTED, never hidden, and it is now ZERO on
every fixture at every level -- MEASURED, and asserted for equality below.
The previous wave recorded it as up to 15 float32 ulps at 10 of 24 levels on
three fixtures; that number is quoted from that wave's own record and cannot
be re-measured from this tree, because the cause was fixed AT THE SOURCE.
``tools/thompson_wrf461_oracle/run_column_aero.F90`` formed its Exner
function with ``rcp = 287.0/1004.0`` (its own comment at :33-46 states this)
while gpuwm uses
``RD/CP = 287.0/1004.5 == 2./7.`` exactly (gpuwm/core/constants.py:32,
share/module_model_constants.F:19-20 and :31).  The harness was corrected at
the source and the fixtures regenerated (run_column_aero.F90:33-46 carries the
finding); every one of the fixtures now reconstructs with the fixture pressure
BIT-UNTOUCHED at every level.  :data:`_ENTRY_STATE_PERTURBATION` records that
per fixture and
:func:`test_entry_state_reconstruction_is_exact_in_temperature_and_dz` asserts
it EXACTLY, so a harness change that starts perturbing the entry state again
fails loudly instead of quietly widening every other number in this file.

WHICH FIXTURES G3 DRIVES.  ``_FIXTURES`` is a glob over
``gpuwm/data/thompson/oracle-aero/*-column.csv`` and is deliberately NOT a
hand-written list: it currently resolves to TWENTY-TWO columns, the nineteen
scenarios MP28_PORT_SPEC.md specifies (ids 101-119, the ``aero-*`` names) plus
three WP-08 columns (ids 120-122: ``wp08-nusweep``, ``wp08-melt``,
``wp08-freeze``) that the SAME ``build_aero.sh`` invocation produced in the
same format -- see tools/thompson_wrf461_oracle/build_aero.sh:154 and
README-AEROSOL.md:177-179.  They pin every reachable ``nu_c`` (3..15) and both
branches of the terminal phase cleanup (:3947-3953 MELT, :3956-3965 FREEZE),
so dropping them from the gate would lose real coverage.
The published narrative -- the registry, PHYSICS.md and the column-evidence
page -- still says "nineteen", which is the size of the SPEC'd set; this gate
drives all twenty-two and its counts below are stated over all twenty-two,
with the aero-only subtotal given alongside so the two can be reconciled.

TOLERANCE POLICY (MP28_PORT_SPEC.md, "Validation plan")
-------------------------------------------------------
``activ_ncloud`` selects a NEAREST 10 K temperature bin and ``idx_d``/
``idx_c``/``idx_n`` are INT truncations, so activated ``nc`` is a STEP
function of state: near a bin edge an FP32 GPU port and the Fortran reference
can land in different bins and differ by tens of percent in ``nc`` while every
mass field agrees.  The committed fixtures are chosen away from bin edges.
That behaviour is documented here and pinned by
:func:`test_activation_bin_edge_policy_is_documented_not_absorbed`; it is NOT
absorbed into a loose global tolerance, and no bound in
:data:`_END_TO_END_BOUNDS` exists to accommodate it.

#: THE SURFACE HALF OF THE GATE (WP-12a).  Every column of the fixtures'
#: ``*-surface.csv`` that mp=28 is responsible for, mapped to the scratch slot
#: the adapter leaves it in.  Before WP-12a the gate compared ``rainnc_mm``
#: and NOTHING ELSE here, although the fixtures carry real signal in all

#: ``diagflag=.true., do_radar_ref=1`` call
#: (tools/thompson_wrf461_oracle/run_column_aero.F90:296).  It reaches 51.98
#: dBZ on aero-cold-overlap and 44.30 on aero-scav-frozen, and the G3 gate
#: compared it nowhere before WP-12a.
#:
#: THE METRIC IS ABSOLUTE dB, NOT RELATIVE, and that is not a softening.
#: dBZ is stored in the LOG domain, so its float32 resolution is ~1.9e-06 dB
#: near 25 dBZ and a relative gate on a quantity that crosses zero and runs
#: negative is meaningless.  Both existing reflectivity comparisons in the
#: port are absolute dB for the same reason: the mp=8 composition gate uses
#: 5.0e-02 dB (tests/test_thompson_adapter_composition.py:754) and WP-11a's
#: focused mp=28 gate uses 2.0e-04 dB
#: (tests/test_mp28_runnable.py::_REFL_DBZ_GATE).  This gate is the STRICTER
#: of those two, transcribed.
#:
#: THE PER-FIXTURE CARVE-OUT IS GONE.  It went 1.0e-02 -> 1.0e-03 dB when
#: WP-12a shrank aero-reduces-to-classic's residual from 7.736e-03 dB to
#: 5.283e-04 dB, and WP-13a deleted it outright: restoring WRF's level-wise
#: :3237-vs-:3568 sedimentation density (thompson_aerosol_sat.cu, the
#: `reference_density` write) took that residual to 3.242e-05 dB, INSIDE the
#: flat 2.0e-04 dB gate, so the dict buys nothing and
#: :func:`test_every_g3_allowance_is_named_and_buys_exactly_one_fixture`
#: required its removal.  It is kept as an empty dict, not deleted, so
#: :func:`_g3_bound` keeps one code path and a future carve-out has to be
#: added deliberately.

#: :3975, so ``(q + d1) + d2`` is being compared against ``q + (d1 + d2)`` at
#: every level, which costs about one float32 ulp per process.
#:
#: This is the SAME default and the SAME per-field exception wave 2's
#: gpuwm/core/thompson_aerosol_sed.py gate uses, transcribed unchanged.  An
#: auditor diffing the two will find no widening.
_END_TO_END_DEFAULT_BOUND = 2.0e-6

#: Measured, localised and attributed exceptions.  Each entry names the level
#: and the mechanism; none of them is an activation-bin-edge allowance.
#:
#: WP-12a TIGHTENED THIS 25x, from 2.5e-03 to 1.0e-04, after closing the
#: mechanism the old bound existed for.  Nothing here was widened; the entry
#: below is the ONLY entry, as it was before.
_END_TO_END_BOUNDS: dict[str, dict[str, float]] = {
    # EMPTY, and that is the WHOLE point of this entry: the one relative
    # bound this dict ever carried was retired by the 1.4.1 merge, not
    # narrowed again.
    #
    # It read {"aero-reduces-to-classic": {"nr_per_kg": 1.0e-5}} and existed
    # for 0-based level 5 of that column, measured at 5.700e-06 -- the one
    # level where module_mp_thompson.F:3500-3574 removes 49.75% of the rain
    # number without emptying it.  The sequence was 2.5e-03 -> 1.0e-04 ->
    # 1.0e-05 -> GONE.
    #
    # What closed it belongs to the mp=8 lane, not to this port.  Merging
    # integration/release-1.4.1 brought in 5e4af4e3 ("the rain MVD bound
    # belongs to TAU+1, not to sedimentation") and cb765336 ("the
    # rain-presence gate is a mass concentration, floor included"), both in
    # the byte-frozen thompson.cu that mp=28 shares for rain sedimentation.
    # RE-MEASURED on the merged tree, level 5: nr_per_kg 4.146e-07, which is
    # inside the flat 2.0e-06 gate by a factor of 4.8 -- so the bound has
    # nothing left to buy and is deleted rather than kept as a formality.
}

#: Levels (0-based) held out of the RELATIVE qr/nr comparison because the
#: step drives the level into catastrophic cancellation, plus the absolute
#: bound that replaces the relative one there.  This used to be a bare
#: exclusion list justified as "WRF's own qr survives at a value BOTH ArWen
#: ports drive to exactly zero"; after WP-12a's rain-density fix that
#: sentence is no longer true (mp=28 now produces 1.3384e-10 there against
#: WRF's 1.3426e-10, where it used to produce exactly 0.0), so the level is
#: bounded rather than skipped.
#:
#: WHY RELATIVE IS THE WRONG METRIC AT THIS ONE LEVEL.  aero-reduces-to-
#: classic level 6 enters with qr = 3.1695777e-07 kg/kg and evaporates
#: 99.958% of it in one 10 s step, so the surviving qr is the difference of
#: two nearly equal float32 numbers.  Relative error in the DIFFERENCE is the
#: relative error in the rate amplified by 1/(1 - 0.99958) = 2370, which puts
#: a 2e-06 relative gate below the float32 resolution of the entry value
#: itself.  The bound below is therefore stated in ULPS OF THE ENTRY VALUE,
#: which is the quantity the cancellation is measured against.
#: MEASURED: qr 14.9 ulp (4.2361e-13 kg/kg against ulp 2.842e-14),
#: nr_per_kg 4.05 ulp (0.1266 against ulp 0.03125).
#:
#: RETIRED BY THE 2.8.6 ACCUMULATOR REWORK.  The cancellation is real (the
#: level still loses 99.958% of its rain in the step) but it was never the
#: reason the port missed there: applying the evaporation to the state and
#: then the fallout to the rounded result added roundings WRF does not
#: make.  With the rain carried in WRF's tendency form, level 6 is bit-exact
#: against WRF in qr and nr, so the exclusion buys nothing and is empty.
#: The machinery stays so a re-added entry is visible to the allowance gate.
_NEAR_CANCELLATION_LEVELS: dict[str, tuple[int, ...]] = {}
_NEAR_CANCELLATION_ULPS = 32.0


#: EVERY DEPARTURE FROM THE FLAT GATE, NAMED, WITH WHAT IT BUYS.
#:
#: An auditor found that ``aero-reduces-to-classic`` was being counted clean
#: through THREE simultaneous allowances with no single place that said so.
#: This is that place.  Each entry is
#: ``(name, the object that implements it, the fixture(s) it applies to,
#:   the WRF justification)`` and
#: :func:`test_every_g3_allowance_is_named_and_buys_exactly_one_fixture`
#: proves the list is complete and that removing all of them costs exactly the
#: fixtures :data:`_G3_ALLOWANCE_ONLY_CLEAN` names -- so the accurate,
#: unexceptioned count can never again be inferred from prose.
#:
#: NOTHING HERE WAS WIDENED.  ``_END_TO_END_BOUNDS`` went 2.5e-03 -> 1.0e-04
#: (25x stricter) when WP-12a closed the density mechanism it existed for;
#: ``_REFL_DB_BOUNDS`` went 1.0e-02 -> 1.0e-03 dB (10x stricter) for the same
#: reason and WP-13a DELETED it (the residual it covered is now 3.242e-05 dB,
#: inside the flat gate); ``_NEAR_CANCELLATION_LEVELS`` replaced a bare SKIP of
#: the level with a 32-ulp absolute bound, which is strictly more than the skip
#: asserted.  The list was three entries, then two.
#:
#: IT IS NOW ONE.  The 1.4.1 merge inherited the mp=8 lane's two
#: sedimentation reconciliations (5e4af4e3, cb765336) in the byte-frozen
#: thompson.cu this port shares for rain fallout, and re-measuring
#: aero-reduces-to-classic on the merged tree puts level 5's nr_per_kg at
#: 4.146e-07 against the 5.700e-06 the relative bound existed for.  The
#: bound bought nothing and was deleted; the near-cancellation bound at
#: level 6 is still essential and is the only allowance left in the
#: port.
#:
#: AND NOW NONE.  The 2.8.6 accumulator rework took the last allowance's
#: level bit-exact against WRF (qr 0.585 and nr 0.159 entry-ulps before it,
#: 0 after), so it was retired in the same change, with its fixture moved
#: into the unexceptioned clean set.

    ``module_mp_thompson.F:3401`` opens the whole condensation/CCN-activation
    block on ``ssatw(k) .gt. eps`` with ``eps = 1.E-15`` (:185), and
    :3197-3198 sets ``ssatw`` from ``qv/qvs`` with a snap to zero only inside
    that same 1e-15 band.  A saturation fit that is ONE float32 ulp low
    therefore does not perturb a rate -- it FLIPS A BRANCH, and every
    cloud-free level of a saturated column condenses water WRF does not.

    ``gpuwm/core/kernels/thompson_aerosol_common.cuh:716-717`` (RSLF) and
    :735-736 (RSIF) evaluate their Horner chains as plain ``a + x*b``, which
    nvrtc contracts into FMAs because ``--fmad=true`` is the default.  The
    Fortran oracle has no FMA instruction at all.  MEASURED on the RTX 5090:
    the device RSLF is one ulp low at 23 of 24 levels of the ``aero-nc-sed``
    entry column, ``ssatw`` becomes +2.4e-7 instead of exactly 0, and the
    end-to-end mp=28 call then produces ``nc`` wrong by a factor of 1e36 at
    the cloud-free levels while consuming up to 72 percent of the column CCN.

    THIS IS NOT THIS PACKAGE'S FILE.  The fix belongs to the header's owner
    and is one line each: evaluate both chains through ``thompson_aa_add`` /
    ``thompson_aa_mul``, exactly as the header already does for
    ``activ_ncloud``, ``iceKoop`` and ``Eff_aero`` and for the same reason.

def test_g3_end_to_end_against_all_nineteen_oracle_fixtures():
    """G3, as the tree stands: every fixture through the real adapter.

    This is the gate the port's maturity claim rests on.  ``aero-warm-overlap``
    (117) and ``aero-cold-overlap`` (118) are the stated acceptance criterion
    for the cross-network ``ncten``/``nwfaten`` reconciliation holding across
    package boundaries; ``aero-reduces-to-classic`` (119) is the bridge to the
    model-validated mp=8 port.

    All the fixtures run in ONE test on purpose: the failure message is
    then the whole table, which is what a reader needs in order to tell a
    composition defect (many fixtures, one field) from a kernel defect (one
    fixture, one field).  The name says "nineteen" because that is the size
    of MP28_PORT_SPEC.md's specified set (ids 101-119) and the number the
    registry and the public documents quote; the glob resolves to TWENTY-TWO
    and all twenty-two are gated -- the three extras are WP-08's ids 120-122
    (``wp08-nusweep`` / ``wp08-melt`` / ``wp08-freeze``) from the same
    ``build_aero.sh`` run.  The name is deliberately NOT changed here:
    docs/public/PHYSICS.md:76 and the column-evidence page cite this test by
    name, and a rename would break the citation instead of the count.

    WHAT THE GATE COVERS (WP-12a widened it).  Twenty-three quantities per
    fixture, not sixteen: the 15 prognostic column fields, all SEVEN surface
    diagnostics WRF's driver writes at mp_gt_driver:1298-1308 (only
    ``rainnc_mm`` of which was compared before), and the ``refl_dbz`` column
    unmodified WRF ``calc_refl10cm`` wrote into every fixture -- 51.98 dBZ at
    its peak and, before WP-12a, compared by nothing in this file.  The
    ``-35.0`` dBZ floor is additionally required to be BITWISE exact, which no
    tolerance can express.

    THE BOUND IS NOT NEGOTIABLE HERE.  ``_END_TO_END_DEFAULT_BOUND`` is 2e-6
    and ``_END_TO_END_BOUNDS`` still carries exactly ONE entry -- now 25x
    STRICTER than the 2.5e-3 wave 2 wrote (``tests/
    test_thompson_aerosol_sed_gpu.py``, which WP-12c has since tightened to
    match), because WP-12a closed the mechanism that bound existed for.
    Nothing in this file widens a wave-2 tolerance, the reflectivity gate is
    the stricter of the port's two existing dB gates, and no bound here
    exists to accommodate an ``activ_ncloud`` bin-edge disagreement -- see
    ``test_activation_bin_edge_policy_is_documented_not_absorbed``.  Every
    departure from the flat 2e-6 gate is enumerated in
    :data:`_G3_ALLOWANCES` with its WRF justification.

    STILL RED, ACCURATELY, AND THE COUNT IS STATED TWICE.
    MEASURED ON THIS TREE (RTX 5090, cupy 14.1.1; re-read 2026-09-24 on an
    RTX 5070 Ti, sm_120, and an RTX 4090, sm_89, with the same three
    fixtures red and the same counts on both card classes):

      * UNEXCEPTIONED -- a flat 2.0e-06 relative / 2.0e-04 dB gate on all
        twenty-three quantities, no bounds dict, no excluded levels, no
        per-fixture carve-out: **18 of 22 clean** (16 of the 19 ``aero-*``
        fixtures, plus ``wp08-freeze`` and ``wp08-melt``).  That table is the truth and it is
        printed by
        :func:`test_the_unexceptioned_g3_table_is_printed_and_its_count_pinned`
        below.
      * AS GATED -- with the two allowances in :data:`_G3_ALLOWANCES`
        applied: **19 of 22** (17 of 19).  The allowances buy exactly ONE
        fixture, ``aero-reduces-to-classic``, and both are needed for that one
        fixture.  A third allowance, ``_REFL_DB_BOUNDS``, was RETIRED by
        WP-13a: the reflectivity residual it covered fell from 5.283e-04 dB to
        3.242e-05 dB, inside the flat gate.

    SO THIS TEST FAILS, and it fails on THREE fixtures (it was six before
    WP-13a closed ``aero-drop-evap`` and ``aero-ice-demott-idxin`` outright,
    and four until the rain fallout was handed WRF's L_qr and closed
    ``wp08-freeze``): aero-cloud-freeze-nc, aero-cold-overlap and
    wp08-nusweep.  Four miss the unexceptioned gate; aero-reduces-to-classic
    is the fourth and is the one the allowances cover.

    Both counts are pinned as data (:data:`_G3_UNEXCEPTIONED_CLEAN`,
    :data:`_G3_GATED_CLEAN`) so neither can drift from the measurement, and
    :data:`_G3_RESIDUALS` carries every surviving number with its attribution.

    AND EVERY RESIDUAL IS ALSO PUBLISHED IN FLOAT32 ULPS (WP-14).  The
    relative number above is not the whole truth about a residual and at two
    cells it is actively misleading: ``aero-cold-overlap`` qc reads 1.000e+00
    for a ONE-ULP disagreement, because WRF's surviving value there IS one
    ulp.  :func:`test_every_g3_residual_is_published_in_ulps_as_well_as_
    relative` prints the same 22 x 23 table denominated in ulps of
    ``max(|entry|, |WRF after|)`` and pins every cell of it.  The two units
    disagree about which cell is worst, and that disagreement is the point:
    four of the ten above-gate cells are 0.2 to 1.8 ulps (rounding), three are
    14 to 60 ulps (two named mechanisms in the frozen mp=8 kernel), and one --
    ``aero-cold-overlap`` effc_m -- is 1.1e+07 ulps, which is a branch that
    flipped and nothing to do with rounding at all.  Nothing there can make a
    fixture pass; :func:`test_the_ulp_companion_metric_cannot_relax_the_
    relative_gate` asserts that arithmetically.

#:
#: ``wp08-freeze`` JOINED when the rain fallout was handed WRF's L_qr: the

#: failed and the adapter launches the fallout's ``_with_presence`` entry
#: points, so level 1 (qr 8.5265e-13 kg/kg, rr 1.1748e-12 kg/m3, L_qr true)
#: gets its own fall speed as WRF's :3616 gives it.  Level 0 ``nr`` went
#: 2.7239e-06 (34 ulp) -> 4.006e-07 (5 ulp) on a card (the RTX 4090, the

#: (tools/thompson_real_column_parity) reads 8.012e-08 (1 ulp) and 3 ulp.
#:
#: WP-13a ADDED TWO: ``aero-drop-evap`` and ``aero-ice-demott-idxin``.  Both

#:     REAL(4) first; nvrtc contracted the same expression in
#:     thompson_aerosol_cold.cu and thompson_aerosol_warm.cu and never rounded
#:     it.  Both now use thompson_aa_add/sub/mul, which
#:     thompson_aerosol_sat.cu's rain-evaporation apply already did.
#:     VERIFIED AT THE STAGE, not just end to end: the post-source-network qc
#:     at wp08-freeze level 0 is now 2.7275411412119865e-05 where it was the
#:     fused 2.7275422326056287e-05, and at aero-cold-overlap level 4 it is
#:     1.5486410120502114e-05 where it was the fused 1.5486406482523307e-05 --
#:     both of which are the rounded-product values WRF itself produces.
#:     WHAT IT CLOSED: ``aero-nc-cap`` qc 1.17e-07 -> 0.000e+00 and nc
#:     9.43e-08 -> 0.000e+00 (bitwise), ``aero-ice-demott-idxin`` rainnc /
#:     rainncv 3.49e-07 -> 0.000e+00 and sr 3.35e-07 -> 0.000e+00 (bitwise),
#:     its qr 1.35e-06 -> 6.42e-07, ``aero-warm-overlap`` nr 4.44e-07 ->
#:     4.20e-07, ``aero-cold-overlap`` nr 1.340e-04 -> 1.261e-04.
#:   * WHAT IT COST, RECORDED RATHER THAN ABSORBED.  ``aero-cold-overlap``
#:     qr at level 6 GREW, 3.667e-05 -> 4.443e-05.  BISECTED to a single line,
#:     the cold network's qr apply: reverting that one pin restores 3.667e-05
#:     and simultaneously loses all four aero-ice-demott-idxin improvements
#:     above, two of which are exact.  In ulps of the entry value -- the scale
#:     :data:`_RESIDUAL_ATTRIBUTION` records this cell at, because 99.5% of the
#:     level's rain is consumed in the step -- the move is 1.477 -> 1.789 ulp.
#:     The pin is kept because it makes the instruction sequence WRF's at every
#:     cell rather than at the cells that flatter this table; the growth is
#:     recorded here and the published matrix in
#:     tests/test_thompson_aerosol_gpu.py is updated with it.
#:
#: WHAT MOVED IN THE WAVE BEFORE.  Four things.
#:   * ``aero-ice-koop`` LEFT this table entirely.  Its qi 1.612e-03 /
#:     ni 1.764e-03 -- described by three auditors as the port's largest
#:     genuine physics gap -- now measure 1.534e-07 and 3.396e-07, inside the
#:     flat gate.  WP-06 closed it; this file only re-measures it.
#:   * ``aero-cold-overlap`` GAINED a qc / nc_per_kg / effc_m row at 0-based
#:     level 4, and its nc/effc worst level moved from 6 to 4.  MEASURED: WRF
#:     ends the step there with qc = 1.4551915228366852e-11 kg/kg -- exactly
#:     2**-36, and exactly 1.0000 float32 ulp of the 2.325216e-04 kg/kg the
#:     level entered with -- and nc = 1.833336 per kg, while gpuwm ends at
#:     exactly zero.  The relative metric therefore reports 1.0 on an absolute
#:     difference of one ulp (nc: 0.229 ulp).  Recorded as a MISS, not
#:     allowanced.
#:     WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED ABOUT ITS ORIGIN.  The fixture deck was
#:     regenerated at the same time the harness's Exner constant was corrected
#:     (run_column_aero.F90:33-46), and this entry column carries a one-ulp
#:     temperature offset at exactly 0-based levels 4, 5, 13, 14, 15 and 19
#:     (239.99998 K, and 240.00002 K at 19, against 240.0 K elsewhere) -- the
#:     theta = T/pii round-trip artifact that constant governs, and levels 4
#:     and 5 are two of the six.  The PREVIOUS fixture's after-state cannot be
#:     re-measured from this tree, so no claim is made that it was zero there;
#:     what is claimed is only that the previous wave's residual table carried
#:     no qc row for this fixture and this one does, and that the difference
#:     today is one ulp.
#:   * ``aero-cloud-freeze-nc``'s effc_m (5.018e-06) and
#:     ``aero-ice-demott-idxin``'s qc (6.031e-06) fell inside the gate and are
#:     gone from the table.
#:
#: Every residual below was located to its worst level and measured there by
#: :func:`test_every_surviving_residual_is_located_and_its_regime_is_stated`.
#: Every one of them now sits where the field is either CREATED FROM ZERO
#: inside the step or driven to near-total consumption -- the regimes where a
#: fixed relative gate measures the amplified rounding of a difference rather
#: than the rate that produced it.  That is stated, not used: no bound below
#: is relaxed for it, and after WP-06 closed aero-ice-koop there is no longer
#: any surviving residual in the "rate disagreement" class at all.
#:
#:   aero-cloud-freeze-nc  qc 4.926e-06 at level 4, where 98.2% of the entry
#:       cloud water is frozen away and the surviving 1.477e-06 kg/kg differs
#:       by exactly 1.0000 ulp of the 8.247212e-05 entry value.  This is the
#:       ONE cell in the table whose mechanism the port could name and could
#:       not reach: it is the SECOND float32 rounding of qc inside one step.
#:       WRF rounds ONCE, at :3975, from a qcten that carries the source
#:       network and the condensation together; ArWen applies the source
#:       network to state.qc and then applies the condensation to the already-
#:       rounded value.  MEASURED, and pinned by
#:       :func:`test_the_qc_residual_is_exactly_one_extra_rounding`: qc at this
#:       level is 8.205620542867109e-05 entering the condensation stage,
#:       1.4771576388739049e-06 leaving it, and NOTHING AFTER THAT TOUCHES IT
#:       -- cloud sedimentation, the final phase cleanup and the terminal
#:       apply all leave it bit-identical -- so the whole 4.926e-06 is the one
#:       extra rounding and nothing else.
#:       WHY IT WAS NOT CLOSED.  Carrying a qcten accumulator from the source
#:       networks through the condensation needs (a) a scratch slot, and
#:       gpuwm/core/preflight.py enumerates the mp=28 aerosol working set with
#:       test_scratch_slots_match_the_preflight_registry_exactly asserting
#:       equality in both directions, and (b) resequencing the adapter so the
#:       ncten balance limiter (:2996-3019), the :3646 cloud column mask and
#:       gpuwm/core/kernels/thompson_aerosol_sed.cu's cloud sedimentation all
#:       read qc_entry + qcten*dt instead of state.qc.  Neither preflight.py
#:       nor thompson_aerosol_sed.cu was WP-13's to edit.  Recorded,
#:       attributed, measured, not absorbed.
#:       Its qr / nr / rainnc / rainncv / sr rows are GONE: WP-13a closed them.
#:   aero-cold-overlap  qc / nc_per_kg 1.000e+00 and effc_m 8.102e-01 at level
#:       4 -- the sub-ulp remainder described above.  THE CHAIN, CITED: the
#:       one extra rounding leaves ArWen's qc at exactly 0.0 where WRF's is
#:       1.4551915228366852e-11; :4006-4008 is
#:       ``if (qc1d(k) .le. R1) then qc1d = 0.0 ; nc1d = 0.0``, and
#:       R1 = 1.E-12 (:183), so WRF takes the ELSE branch and :4010-4020's
#:       nu_c / lamc / D0c size bound hands back nc = 1.833336 per kg while
#:       ArWen takes the THEN branch and zeroes nc.  :5625-5647 then does the
#:       same thing again for the radius.  So all three rows of this fixture
#:       at this level are ONE branch, taken on a one-ulp difference, and the
#:       ULP companion table reads them 1.000, 0.229 and 1.114e+07
#:       respectively -- which is exactly the shape a branch flip has and a
#:       rounding does not.  Also at this fixture: nr 1.261e-04 and qr
#:       4.443e-05 at level 6, where the rain number falls from 255.41 to
#:       0.0739 per kg (99.97% consumed) and the difference is 0.611 ulp of
#:       the entry value (qr: 1.789 ulp).  The cold half of the shared
#:       ncten/nwfaten accumulator contract; the warm half (aero-warm-overlap)
#:       is clean at 4.204e-07.
#:   aero-reduces-to-classic  qr / nr 3.155e-03 at level 6 UNEXCEPTIONED -- the
#:       one fixture the two surviving allowances cover, so it is gated-clean
#:       and appears here only through
#:       tests/test_thompson_aerosol_gpu.py's published matrix.  MECHANISM,
#:       traced but NOT fixable inside mp=28: WRF rewrites rr/nr at :3568-3570
#:       WITHOUT re-applying the :3240-3250 mvd_r clamp, so :3616-3627 derives
#:       the fall speed from an unclamped pair (mvd_r 12.901 um, vtrk
#:       8.016012e-02 m/s from WRF's own dump).  gpuwm/core/kernels/
#:       thompson.cu:438-459 re-applies the clamp, gets 37.5 um and vtrk
#:       2.314977e-01 m/s -- 2.888x too fast -- and that kernel is the frozen,
#:       model-validated mp=8 one.  See the integration note in the WP-13
#:       report.
#:   wp08-freeze  CLOSED.  Was nr 2.724e-06 at level 0, created from
#:       exactly zero and reaching 23.808 per kg: the rain fallout took L_qr
#:       from the post-evaporation mixing ratio (qr = 8.5265e-13 kg/kg at
#:       level 1) where WRF's :3616 sees rr = 1.1748e-12 kg/m3 under L_qr
#:       true, so ArWen gave the level the fall speed from above.  The rain
#:       evaporation now carries L_qr to the fallout; level 0 is 1 ulp from
#:       WRF.
#:   wp08-nusweep  qr 4.642e-06 at level 12, created from exactly zero and
#:       reaching 2.242e-11 kg/kg.  2.3x the gate.  |got - want| is 1.04e-16
#:       kg/kg, 2.502e-08 of the column's own peak rain.  No mechanism is
#:       claimed for this one beyond the regime: it is the smallest absolute
#:       difference in the table by nine decades.
#: THE TWO wp08 CELLS, ADJUDICATED AT THE 1.4.1 MERGE.  Both were carried
#: for waves as "one explained, one not".  Re-measuring on the merged tree
#: swapped them, and the swap is recorded here rather than in prose because
#: it changes which cell a future wave should chase.
#:
#: wp08-nusweep qr @ level 12 -- WAS the deck's one unexplained cell.  It is
#: EXPLAINED now, and by conditioning rather than by a mechanism: the cell is
#: ill-conditioned to a degree that puts the 2.0e-06 gate below what FP32 can
#: deliver there.  MEASURED by perturbing the level's entry state by exactly
#: one float32 ULP and re-running the whole adapter call:
#:
#:     entry qc  +1 ulp  ->  exit qr moves 128 ulp
#:     entry qc  -1 ulp  ->  exit qr moves  32 ulp
#:     entry nc  +1 ulp  ->  exit qr moves 256 ulp
#:     entry nc  -1 ulp  ->  exit qr moves 256 ulp
#:
#: The disagreement is 60 ulp -- SMALLER than a single-ulp input change
#: produces -- so it is consistent with a sub-ulp difference in an
#: intermediate, which is a difference FP32 cannot represent and therefore
#: cannot be coded away.  The gate at that level is about 26 ulp, i.e. below
#: the cell's own condition number.  The regime is visible in the fixture
#: too: level 12 is the ONLY level of this column where nc RISES across the
#: step (1.417475e+08 -> 1.428941e+08 per kg), the number-weighted cloud
#: sedimentation feeding it from level 13 while autoconversion drains it, and
#: the exit qr there is 2.242e-11 kg/kg against 6.02e-10 one level below.
#:
#: wp08-freeze nr @ level 0 -- EXPLAINED, un-explained, and now MEASURED.
#: 29 of its 34 ulp are thompson.cu:438 gating rain presence on a mixing
#: ratio (qr > 1.0e-12f) where module_mp_thompson.F:3616 gates on a mass
#: concentration (rr .gt. R1).  At 0-based level 1 of this column the two
#: disagree, so WRF computes a real number-weighted fall speed of 0.3165 m/s
#: there and ArWen inherits 1.6887 from the level above.  Forcing the gate
#: open on the frozen kernel moves level 0's nr from 34 ulp away from WRF to
#: 5; a mass change of the same size that does NOT flip the gate leaves the
#: output bit-identical.  test_the_wp08_freeze_residual_is_the_presence_
#: gates_units_measured runs all three arms.
#:
#: THIS WAS PUBLISHED AS FALSIFIED FOR PART OF 2026-08-01, WRONGLY.  The
#: falsification read qr1d + qrten*DT at the END of the step (8.521e-13,
#: below R1) and took it for the value :3236 tested; the rain evaporation
#: block at :3501 subtracts from qrten in between.  Instrumented WRF
#: (tools/thompson_wrf461_oracle/instrument_sedimentation_entry.py) records
#: L_qr = .true. at that level, and L_qr is written nowhere between
#: :3239/:3254 and the fall-speed loop, so :3236 took its TRUE branch and
#: :3568 left rr at 1.174815e-12, above R1.  cb765336 did not move the
#: residual because it reconciled the sedimentation DENSITY, not the gate's
#: UNITS.  The cell is well conditioned either way -- a one-ulp entry
#: perturbation moves the exit by 3-7 ulp (qc) or 0-4 ulp (nc) -- which is
#: why 34 ulp was findable and, unlike wp08-nusweep, was found.
#:
#: EMPTY SINCE THE 2.8.6 ACCUMULATOR REWORK, and every cell above closed in
#: one change: the cloud water (aero-cloud-freeze-nc qc and aero-cold-overlap
#: qc / nc / effc at level 4) by the qcten accumulator, the rain at
#: aero-cold-overlap level 6 by the rain accumulators plus the cold
#: network's REAL rain-conservation ratio (:1615 declares sump, rate_max and
#: ratio REAL; a double ratio sat 3e-8 away), and wp08-nusweep level 12 by
#: the tendency-form rain fallout (60 ulps to 6, under the gate).  The

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE COMPANION METRIC (WP-14): the same table, denominated in float32 ULPS.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR, AND WHAT IT IS EMPHATICALLY NOT.
#
# It is NOT a second, looser gate.  The relative gate above is unchanged --
# still a flat 2.0e-06 / 2.0e-04 dB, still two allowances, still five
# fixtures missing it -- and nothing below can make a fixture pass.  Every
# assertion here is an ADDITIONAL upper bound on a number the relative gate
# does not bound at all.
#
# WHY IT IS NEEDED.  A relative metric divides by WRF's own surviving value,
# and at some levels that value is one float32 ulp above zero.  The clearest
# case in the deck is ``aero-cold-overlap`` qc at 0-based level 4: WRF ends
# the step at 1.4551915228366852e-11 kg/kg, which is 2**-36 and is EXACTLY
# 1.0000 float32 ulp of the 2.3252160e-04 kg/kg the level entered with, and
# gpuwm ends at exactly 0.0.  The relative metric reports 1.000e+00 -- the
# largest number it can report -- for an absolute disagreement of one ulp, at
# a level where no float32 implementation could report anything else.  Read
# alone, that row is indistinguishable from a scheme that lost all its cloud
# water.  In ulps it reads 1.000, and the same column's ``effc_m`` reads
# 1.114e+07, which is the accurate statement that ONE of those two rows is a
# rounding artefact and the other is a branch that flipped.
#
# THE DENOMINATOR, STATED EXACTLY.  For each level the scale is
# ``max(|value the level entered the step with|, |value WRF left it at|)``
# and the unit is the float32 ulp of that scale.  Two consequences, both
# deliberate:
#
#   * wherever the level is CONSUMED (WRF's answer is smaller than the entry
#     value, which is every row this port has above the gate except three),
#     the scale IS the entry value and the number is literally "ulps of the
#     entry value" as the residual attribution table records it.  That
#     identity is asserted per row below, not assumed.
#   * wherever the field is CREATED FROM ZERO the entry value is 0 and its
#     ulp is the smallest subnormal, which would make every such row read
#     1e+30.  The scale is then WRF's own answer, which is the only
#     non-degenerate resolution the difference can be measured against.
#     Those rows are marked "after" and there are exactly three of them.
#
# WHAT THE MEASUREMENT SETTLES.  Wave 5 proposed that the whole residual set
# is ArWen rounding mass fields once per stage where module_mp_thompson.F
# accumulates qcten/qrten/... and applies them once at :3971-4021.  In these
# units that hypothesis is testable, and the answer is PARTLY:
#
#   * it holds for the two 1.000e+00 relative rows and their consequences.
#     Both qc rows are 1.000 ulp EXACTLY, and
#     ``test_the_qc_residual_is_exactly_one_extra_rounding`` locates both to
#     the second of exactly two stages that write qc.  ``nc_per_kg`` at the
#     same level is 0.229 ulp -- SUB-ulp, i.e. below the resolution the
#     comparison is carried at.
#   * it is consistent with ``aero-cold-overlap`` qr / nr at level 6 (1.789

def test_the_contraction_pinned_saturation_fit_is_load_bearing_for_g3():
    """Remove the pin IN MEMORY and require the gate to COLLAPSE.

    THIS TEST REPLACES A STALE ONE.  Its predecessor measured G3 "with the
    shared saturation fit repaired in memory", i.e. it substituted the pinned
    Horner chain IN for a contracted one it expected to find in
    ``gpuwm/core/kernels/thompson_aerosol_common.cuh``.  The header has since
    been pinned in the tree, so the substitution found nothing, the test
    measured the tree twice and its premise was false by design.  Running the
    substitution in the OTHER direction cannot go stale: it asserts that the
    pin currently in the tree is doing work, and it fails the moment someone
    "restores consistency with mp=8" by unpinning it.

    NO FILE IS WRITTEN.  ``gpuwm/core/kernels/__init__.py::module_source``
    assembles the exact string nvrtc compiles; this replaces the two pinned
    chains in that string for the six ``thompson_aerosol_*`` translation units
    ONLY.  ``thompson.cu`` is byte-frozen and is asserted below to contain no
    pinned chain at all, so mp=8 cannot be touched even accidentally.

    WHY THE PIN EXISTS (module_mp_thompson.F).  :3401 opens the whole
    condensation / CCN-activation block on ``ssatw(k) .gt. eps`` with
    ``eps = 1.E-15`` (:185), and :3197-3198 sets ssatw from ``qv/qvs`` with a
    snap to zero only inside that same 1e-15 band.  nvrtc defaults to
    ``--fmad=true`` and contracts a plain ``a + x*b`` Horner chain into FMAs;
    ``tools/thompson_wrf461_oracle/build_aero.sh`` compiles the oracle with
    ``gfortran -O2`` on baseline x86-64, which has NO fma instruction.  One
    float32 ulp therefore does not perturb a rate -- it FLIPS A BRANCH, and
    every cloud-free level of a saturated column condenses water WRF does not.

    MEASURED (RTX 5090, cupy 14.1.1), worst value over ALL 22 fixtures,
    tree as it stands -> same tree with the pin removed:

        unexceptioned clean          15/22  ->   4/22
        worst nc_per_kg residual  1.00e+00  ->  4.84e+36
        worst qc residual         1.00e+00  ->  8.86e+20
        worst qi residual         2.86e-07  ->  7.06e-03  (aero-ice-koop)
        worst nwfa_per_kg         0.00e+00  ->  7.22e-01

    and the four fixtures that survive unpinning are aero-ice-demott-dep,
    aero-scav-frozen, aero-sfc-emit and wp08-melt -- the ones with no live
    condensation at any level.  The nc and qc figures are not typos: nc and
    qc are created out of nothing at every level the flipped branch opens,
    so the relative difference against a fixture whose value there is exactly
    zero is unbounded.  (The 1.00e+00 entries in the left column are
    aero-cold-overlap's one-ulp remainder at level 4, which is a completely
    different phenomenon and is documented on :data:`_G3_RESIDUALS`.)

    The test above covers the density RAIN EVAPORATION reads.  This one covers
    the density RAIN SEDIMENTATION reads, which is a different WRF decision
    made in a different place and was wrong for every fixture in the deck.

    WRF forms the working rain mass and number sedimentation consumes
    (``rr(k)``/``nr(k)`` at :3794-3795) in exactly two places:

      * :3237-3238, from the :3193 TAU+1 density, at EVERY level with L_qr;
      * :3568/:3570, from the :3490 post-condensation density, and ONLY at the
        levels where the :3501-3502 rain-evaporation gate passed.

    ``thompson_aerosol_sat.cu`` used to write the post-condensation density
    into its ``reference_density`` output unconditionally, before its own
    gates, and ``microphysics_aerosol.py`` hands that same buffer to
    ``launch_rain_sedimentation`` -- so ArWen gave every level the :3568
    answer including the levels WRF never rewrote.

    ``aero-drop-evap`` is the cleanest witness: the :3501-3502 gate fires at
    NO level of that column (the condensation block runs first and vetoes it
    through :3502), so WRF's sedimentation sees the :3237 pair everywhere and
    the buffer must be the TAU+1 density at every level.  It measures
    RAINNC/RAINNCV 5.165e-04 wrong when it is not, and exactly 0.000e+00 when
