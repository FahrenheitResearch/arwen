"""Every door that publishes a configuration answers the route question.

The domain, forcing, schedule and saved-setup editors, ``domain-fit``,
``domain-tiles`` and the following-nest authoring door are driven in
``test_companion_domains_route_companions.py``.  Four publishers are
left, and they are the ones a reader would not think to look for: the
bundle publisher two creation doors share, the local cycling publisher,
and the draft retained when a configuration is refused for memory.

Each is driven HERE at its own publisher function, over bytes the real
emission door wrote, with no catalog, no archive and no device: the
question the publisher has to answer -- what does this configuration's
route read beside it -- belongs to the configuration, not to the
selection, the recipe or the card that produced it.
