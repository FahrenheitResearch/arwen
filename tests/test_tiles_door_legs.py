"""The two front-door nesting legs, graded without a card.

``tools/tiles_door_legs.py`` needs a GPU, an ERA5 bundle and about half an
hour, so it runs on the GPU leg from ``tools/battery/tiles_gates.txt``.
Everything ABOUT it that can rot silently is checked here instead, on every
commit, for the reason ``tests/test_tiles_gate_manifest.py`` gives for
itself: a gate that stops existing must fail on a commit rather than at a
cut, on the node, when there is no time.

What rots:

* the two entries losing their ``LEG=`` environment, which would run leg A
  twice and report two passes;
* a template acquiring a committed ``vram_budget_bytes``, which turns a
  card fact into a claim about whichever box last touched it;
* a user path or a scratchpad path surviving into a committed case file;
* the SHAPES drifting -- if leg B stopped carrying a per-domain ``on`` it
  would still pass its own gate while testing leg A's shape twice.

The last one is the one worth stating plainly: these files are the only
place the two shapes are written down, so a gate that ran them faithfully
would still prove nothing if the files stopped describing what their names
say.
