# tests/test_shipped_configs_mixing_stability.py
"""No config under ``configs/`` may ship in the exposed-mixing state.

The 1.6.0 anisotropic-mixing instability was closed with a criterion and
a warning, and then the shipped example configs kept the setting that
trips it: the two 250 m nested-LES trees at
``mix_upper_bound*(dz_max/dx)^2 = 0.702`` and both 100 m tornado trees at
4.23, 17x the limit -- the last of which aborted a run at step 5467 with
w = 239 m/s.  Nothing in the repository would have noticed, because the
criterion was checked against a configuration only when somebody loaded
one and read the stderr.

This file is the thing that notices.  It walks every TOML under
``configs/``, resolves it through the loader a user's run would use, and
requires the criterion to hold on every domain.  The remedy when it
fails is the one the advisory names and the one attempt #3 ruled on:
``mix_isotropic = 1``, or a ``mix_upper_bound`` under the admitted
value.

FROZEN RECORDS ARE THE ONE EXEMPTION, AND THEY ARE PINNED BY CONTENT.
A config a committed receipt was produced under is a record: it has to
keep saying what it said, exposed setting and all.  Each one is listed
in :data:`FROZEN_RECORDS` with the sha256 of its bytes, so the exemption
cannot be widened by editing a record and cannot be reused to smuggle a
new config into the exposed state -- a new file has no entry, and an
edited file no longer matches its entry.

CPU only, no card, no data.

    Routed exactly the way a run routes it: an experiment TOML through
    ``load_experiment``, anything else through the legacy loader.

    An experiment TOML that omits ``eta_levels`` is NOT a hole: the
    exposure helper resolves the ladder the model would build from
    ``nz``/``ztop`` and the criterion runs on that.  Skipping it was the
    hole -- see
    :func:`gpuwm.experiment.anisotropic_w_mixing_exposure` and
    :func:`test_an_experiment_with_no_eta_ladder_is_still_judged` below.

    NOR IS A LADDER THAT WILL NOT RESOLVE AT ALL.  Where the depths come
    back non-finite the ratio is ``None`` -- there is no number -- and
    routing on the ratio alone put that case back in the silence the
    resolution work had just taken it out of.  The screen therefore asks
    :func:`gpuwm.config.anisotropic_w_mixing_advice`, which answers with
    an advisory in that case, and reports the domain with an infinite
    ratio: the same convention the legacy branch below already uses, and
    for the same reason -- the config is on the exposed path and nothing
    can say where it sits relative to the limit.

    The legacy path deserves its own sentence.  A legacy RunConfig is
    not routed through the experiment loader at all here -- it is read
    as raw TOML -- so no ladder is resolved for it and no ratio can be
    computed.  A legacy config that SELECTS the exposed path is
    therefore reported with an infinite ratio: not because it is known
    to be unstable, but because on that route nothing can tell anyone
    whether it is.

    It is read as raw TOML rather than through ``load_config``, because
    several files under ``configs/`` carry tables that loader does not
    own (``[ensemble]``, ``[case_data]``, ``[static]``) and refuses
    outright.  A screen that skipped whatever failed to load would be a
    screen with holes in exactly the places nobody looks.

    resolution itself fails -- a model top above the analytic base
    state's ceiling -- and that one went quiet at every door, because the
    exposure's ``inf`` sentinel went into ``anisotropic_w_mixing_ratio``
    and came back out as ``None``, which is the same value the function
    returns for "not on the exposed path at all".

    SELECTS the per-axis mixing length at 100 m spacing and no depth
    exists to judge it by.  The screen reports it with an infinite ratio,
    and the advisory door says in words that the number is missing.
