# One-command install for a gpuwm (ArWen) developer checkout (POSIX sh).
#
#   ./install.sh [--yes] [--no-render] [--cuda 12|13] [--python PY]
#                                           -- from a checkout root
#
# The standalone (curl | sh) form clones the public repository into
# ./gpuwm when run outside a checkout; GPUWM_REPO_URL overrides the
# clone source (fork or mirror).
#
# What it does, in order (every step is re-run safe):
#   1. finds the checkout (or clones $GPUWM_REPO_URL into ./gpuwm);
#   2. makes sure a Rust toolchain is present, offering to install
#      rustup when `cargo` is missing (prompts first; --yes or
#      GPUWM_INSTALL_YES=1 consents non-interactively);
#   3. creates .venv if absent on free-threaded CPython 3.14t (see
#      "Interpreter" below), installs the checkout's gpuwm-data
#      companion, then installs -e '.[gpu-cuNN,render]' into it,
#      where NN is the CUDA major this box's driver reports (CuPy
#      ships one wheel per major and the wrong one dies at its first
#      cuBLAS load); --cuda overrides the detection, and an
#      undetectable major is announced rather than defaulted quietly;
#   4. stages the externalized Thompson tables with `gpuwm fetch-tables`
#      (downloads only what is absent -- ~243 MiB from a checkout --
#      SHA-256 verified before install; a no-op when already staged;
#      skip with --no-fetch-tables or GPUWM_INSTALL_NO_FETCH_TABLES=1);
#   5. builds the vendored Rust GRIB bridges offline in
#      tools/grib1_bridge;
#   6. builds the vendored production render engine offline in
#      tools/rustwx (skip with --no-render or
#      GPUWM_INSTALL_NO_RENDER=1);
#   7. builds the terminal workspace offline in tools/arwen-tui;
#   8. builds the regular-grid Zarr reader offline in tools/zarr_bridge,
#      the mapped-source decode engine in tools/rw_wps and the velocity
#      dealiasing library in tools/region_global_dealias (the default
#      decode path and the default dealiasing engine);
#   9. finishes with `gpuwm doctor`, with .venv/bin on its PATH, and
#      exits with doctor's status.
#
# Environment:
#   GPUWM_REPO_URL     clone source when run outside a checkout
#                      (default:
#                      https://github.com/FahrenheitResearch/arwen).
#   GPUWM_PYTHON       interpreter used to create .venv, same as
#                      --python (default: free-threaded CPython 3.14t,
#                      see "Interpreter" below)
#   GPUWM_INSTALL_YES  "1" behaves like --yes
#   GPUWM_INSTALL_NO_RENDER  "1" behaves like --no-render
#   GPUWM_INSTALL_NO_FETCH_TABLES  "1" behaves like --no-fetch-tables
#   GPUWM_INSTALL_CUDA  "12" or "13" behaves like --cuda
#
# Interpreter.  A new .venv is made on free-threaded CPython 3.14t
# (PEP 703): a python3.14t already on PATH, else the one uv finds or
# installs (`uv python install 3.14t`), else, with consent (--yes, or
# the prompt), uv itself from https://astral.sh/uv first.  The gpuwm
# command line then re-executes itself once with PYTHON_GIL=0 (see
# gpuwm/free_threading.py), so nothing has to be exported by hand.
# THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS: every [devices] rank of a multi-card
# forecast steps its card from its own Python thread, and under an
# interpreter lock those threads take turns -- measured 2026-10-03,
# 4 cards ran 289 s per forecast hour with the lock and 130 s on
# 3.14t, so a plain multi-card install ran about 2x slower than the
# published benchmarks.  --python (or GPUWM_PYTHON) picks another
# interpreter; when no 3.14t can be had, none can make a venv, or a
# dependency will not install under it, the install continues on
# python3 (then python) and says, by name, what that costs and how to
# get 3.14t.
