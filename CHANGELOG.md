# Changelog

## 1.0.0 -- first public release (2026-07-29)

ArWen: an independent, GPU-native implementation of a WRF-ARW-class
regional model. Not affiliated with or endorsed by NCAR/UCAR. Research
and educational tool; never a substitute for official warnings.

### Worldwide projections

- Mercator, polar stereographic (both poles), and southern-hemisphere
  Lambert conformal grids now run end to end: `gpuwm domain`
  auto-selects the projection from the point latitude (below 25
  degrees absolute Mercator, 25-60 hemisphere-correct Lambert, above
  60 polar stereographic; `--projection` overrides), the config schema
  gains `[projection] map_proj = "lambert" | "mercator" | "polar"`
  (the `[shared]` integer keeps the WRF convention 1=lambert, 2=polar,
  3=mercator and must agree), and namelist import/emission, the
  WPS_GEOG static build, ERA5/GFS ingest, and the native WRF direct
  export (`MAP_PROJ`/`MAP_PROJ_CHAR` derived per projection) all
  follow.
- Antimeridian-crossing domains are supported: `gpuwm fetch --area`
  reads a longitude pair spanning more than 180 degrees as the
  complementary box crossing 180E, `--point` boxes wrap across the
  seam, and GFS antimeridian crops decode onto a continuous axis.
- New wizard ladder `12` emits a single 12 km domain
  (`restart_interval_s = 0`, the portable prepared-forecast contract).
- `gpuwm check` on a config without `[case_data]` (the GFS/HRRR wizard
  emissions) now prints that the input preflight is not applicable and
  certifies the memory preflight (exit 0) instead of refusing.
- Maturity, stated plainly: the new projections (Mercator, polar
  stereographic, southern-hemisphere Lambert) are oracle-verified and
  smoke-run verified -- transcription gates at binary64 against a
  Fortran oracle built from the pinned WRF v4.6.1
  `share/module_llxy.F` (tools/llxy_wrf461_oracle, fixtures in
  tests/data/llxy_oracle, gates in tests/test_projection_oracle.py
  with measured max-ULP ceilings) plus short GPU smoke integrations --
  NOT matched-run verified. The deep matched-run validation (the 1974
  reference family, geo_em byte-level gates) remains
  northern-hemisphere Lambert only.
- Genuine limits that remain: domains containing or touching a pole
  are refused; forcing footprints wider than 180 degrees of longitude
  are refused; latitude-longitude (cylindrical) and rotated grids fail
  closed; HRRR remains CONUS Lambert only (worldwide points use GFS or
  ERA5, both global).

### The model

- WRF-ARW-class compressible nonhydrostatic core (RK3, split-explicit
  acoustics) in FP32 on CUDA; one-way static Lambert-conformal nests
  with WRF-recurrent boundary-clock semantics.
- Physics transcribed from WRF v4.6.1 (`d66e442f`) with per-option
  maturity labels (docs/public/PHYSICS.md): Kessler, WSM6, Thompson
  (model-validated; WRF tables SHA-256-pinned -- the two largest are
  published as release assets and staged by `gpuwm fetch-tables`,
  which install runs automatically), Morrison
  2-moment, NSSL 2-moment (validation-candidate) microphysics; YSU and
  MYNN PBL; MM5 and MYNN surface layers; Noah, Noah-MP, and RUC land
  surface; RTE+RRTMGP (default) and legacy-RRTMG (verification tier)
  radiation; Kain-Fritsch cumulus.
- Verification against WRF v4.6.1 at three levels -- component ULP
  oracles, t=0 initialization parity, matched 6 h four-domain forecast
  to 500 m -- with published decay tables and explicit non-claims
  (docs/public/VERIFICATION.md). Measured: 6 h on a 250x200x49 domain
  with full physics in 3.6 min on one RTX 5090.

### The product surface (all new in this release)

- `gpuwm fetch` -- GFS (NOMADS subsets), HRRR (AWS byte-range), and
  ERA5 (CDS request templates + validation); resumable, manifested,
  refuses changed requests instead of silently reusing files.
- `gpuwm domain` -- point + GPU tier to a sized experiment TOML via
  the real VRAM estimator (16/24/32 GiB tiers, measured 1.75 peak
  envelope; docs/public/HARDWARE.md).
- `gpuwm check` -- input preflight (decode envelopes, coverage, geog
  tiles, table hashes) plus itemized VRAM preflight with `--alloc`
  device verification.
- `gpuwm run` / `resume` -- supervised forecasts, atomic
  `run-progress.json`, failure capsules, restart checkpoints with
  fail-closed identity checks.
- `gpuwm render` -- composite reflectivity, T2, 10 m wind, and
  accumulated precipitation PNGs via the `wrf-rust` package.
- `UP_HELI_MAX` -- WRF's 2-5 km updraft-helicity running-max diagnostic
  (`nwp_diagnostics = 1`; wizard configs enable it), oracle-pinned to
  WRF v4.6.1 `cal_helicity` at max ULP 0, trajectory-inert by test,
  restart-carried, reset each history frame; unlocks the renderer's UH
  product family.
- `gpuwm downscale` -- offline finer-nest re-runs from archived ArWen
  or stock-WRF history (ndown-class), explicit boundary-cadence
  contract, measured cadence-cost table (docs/public/DOWNSCALE.md).
- `gpuwm import-namelist` -- WRF namelist pair to experiment TOML with
  a structured substitution report and a one-sweep missing-key census.
- `gpuwm doctor` -- whole-estate diagnosis (CuPy, bridges, tables,
  data roots) with copy-pasteable remedies.
- `rw-wps` -- the native preprocessor: HRRR/GFS/ERA5/mapped sources to
  `wrfinput_d0N`/`wrfbdy_d01` directly (no WPS, no `real.exe`);
  unchanged stock WRF v4.6.1 has accepted and integrated its outputs,
  serial and MPI, nests through d06, within documented boundaries
  (docs/public/WRF-INTEROP.md).

### Packaging and platforms

- Git-checkout install (Windows and POSIX) with one vendored, locked,
  offline Rust build; `[gpu]` and `[render]` extras; the pip wheel
  documented honestly as needing the same bridge build.
- `gpuwm fetch-tables` -- stages the externalized table assets (the
  two largest Thompson tables: freezeH2O.dat, 243 MiB, over GitHub's
  blob limit and PyPI's per-file cap; qr_acr_qg_V4.dat, 71 MiB,
  excluded from the wheel/sdist for the same cap but still in the
  repository) from the version-pinned release assets, verified against
  the packaged SHA-256 pins before an atomic install; refuses
  mismatched bytes and never overwrites an existing file.  The install
  scripts run it automatically; `--from DIR` covers offline installs;
  `gpuwm doctor` prints it as the exact remedy while a table is
  missing.
- Sealed Linux runtime archive and CPU-only Windows x86-64 archive
  with deterministic, hash-manifested builders.
- Uniform CLI refusal contract: documented refusals exit 2 with a
  one-line message, never a traceback.

### Known limits (stated in full in README and VERIFICATION)

Lambert conformal, Mercator, and polar stereographic projections
(pole-containing domains, footprints wider than 180 degrees of
longitude, and lat-lon/rotated grids refused; non-Lambert and
southern-hemisphere grids at oracle + smoke maturity, not matched-run
verified); one-way static nests; FP32; no data assimilation; ERA5
drives the config-driven GPU loop (GFS/HRRR feed the native
preprocessor front door; HRRR is CONUS-only); one case deeply
validated, component evidence elsewhere.

## Pre-1.0 development

Pre-release development history, internal milestone evidence, and
per-change hashes are recorded in PROVENANCE.md and the focused status
documents rather than duplicated here.
