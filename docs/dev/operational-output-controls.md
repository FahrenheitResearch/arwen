# Operational output controls

Authority: NOAA-EMC/HRRR commit
`40ee6058c2fc6624cbfbbe8cf1c20c59e6a45827`, under
`sorc/hrrr_wrfarw.fd/WRFV3.9/`. This is the operational fork, not stock
WRF 4.6.1. Its diagnostic module is **phys/module_diag_gsd.F**;
`phys/module_diag_nwp.F` does not exist at this revision.

## Cadence and precipitation

`history_interval2_s` and `history_interval_change_s` are domain output
controls; a nonzero change requires the second interval. The packaged recipe writes every 900 seconds
through 64800 seconds, then every 3600 seconds. A 48-hour schedule has 103
frames including initialization. Both fixed and adaptive clocks carry the
change, as do native-namelist import/export and prepared history inventories.
Disk admission counts the two alarm phases algebraically, including the
exclusive resume boundary, instead of pricing every frame at the first interval.

`prec_acc_dt` and `prec_acc_dt1` retain WRF's units of minutes (60 and 15).
`module_diag_gsd.F:724-813` resets the corresponding bucket at step-start
`MOD(curr_secs2, interval*60)==0`, then adds the current step. History reads
never reset it. Each interval writes `PREC_ACC_C`, `PREC_ACC_NC`,
`SNOW_ACC_NC`, `GRAUP_ACC_NC`, with suffix `1` for the second interval.
Snow includes convective rain when T2 is below 273.15 K, exactly as the fork.
These are GPU accumulators and restart/streaming carriers.

## GSD inventory and reset authority

Registry.EM_COMMON:2992's `gsd_diags_rt` package contains 13 fields:
`WSPD10MAX`, `W_UP_MAX`, `W_DN_MAX`, `UP_HELI_MAX`, `W_MEAN`,
`GRPL_MAX`, `HAIL_MAXK1`, `HAIL_MAX2D`, `LWP`, `IWP`, `WSPD10`,
`WSPD80`, `MAXCLDFRA`. The module also fills the misc Registry fields
below. They are carried in history, including the fork's lowercase
vorticity variable names.

| Fields | Producer and meaning |
| --- | --- |
| WSPD10MAX, WSPD10UMAX, WSPD10VMAX | Per-step speed maximum and its U/V components |
| WSPD80MAX, WSPD80UMAX, WSPD80VMAX | Declared and reset in the authority, never assigned a nonzero value there |
| W_UP_MAX, W_DN_MAX | Per-step extrema below 100 hPa |
| W_MEAN | Time mean of column-mean W between sigma 0.5 and 0.8 |
| GRPL_MAX | Maximum column integrated graupel, kg m-2 |
| HAIL_MAXK1, HAIL_MAX2D | Thompson fork's 50-bin PSD tail diameter at the first mass level / column maximum, metres |
| REFD_MAX, REFDM10C_MAX | Derived reflectivity maximum at the first mass level / highest -10 C crossing |
| LTG1_MAX, LTG2_MAX, LTG3_MAX | Lightning threats; LTG3 scales by whole-domain LTG1/LTG2 maxima |
| UP_HELI_MAX/MIN, UH | 2-5 km AGL helicity extrema / instantaneous integral |
| UP_HELI_MAX16/MIN16, UH16 | 1-6 km AGL |
| UP_HELI_MAX02/MIN02, UH02 | 0-2 km AGL |
| UP_HELI_MAX03/MIN03, UH03 | 0-3 km AGL |
| rel_vort, rel_vort_max, rel_vort_max01 | Instantaneous 3-D vorticity and fork's 0-2 / 0-1 km extrema |
| WSPD10, WSPD80 | Model-level wind interpolation, filled on the first history-due call after the hourly sentinel reset |
| LWP, IWP, MAXCLDFRA | History-time cloud-water paths and boundary-layer cloud fraction |
| COMPOSITE_REFL_10CM, REFL_10CM_1KM, REFL_10CM_4KM | History-time reflectivity with native convective contribution, base-geopotential height selection and -10 dBZ floor |

`module_diag_gsd.F:817-874` uses `reset_interval1`, default **60 minutes**,
independent of history. It resets before folding the current step; its
position after first-RK helicity means the boundary step's helicity sample
is discarded. `module_diffusion_em.F:6068-6816` owns the four helicity bands
and vorticity, sampled before the dynamics solve. The stock completed-step
UH evaluation remains separate for moving-nest tracking; GSD output does
not change those consumers. All column math, stencil work and reductions
run on the GPU. Restart carries the interval state. Streamed history
recomputes LTG3 after full-domain carriers are assembled, avoiding tile-local
scaling. `tests/test_gsd_output.py` covers these boundaries and inertness.

The fork has an unusual vorticity overwrite: every vertical level compares
against the previous step's 0-2 km maximum, also for the 0-1 km field.
This implementation preserves that comparison rather than replacing it
with a mathematically different vertical reduction.
The previous-value selector also preserves `cal_helicity`'s integer
`MOD(itimestep-1, INT(reset_interval1*60/dt))`, including changes of dt.
Its GPU step counter survives restart and is not cleared by the separate
clock-hour reset in `module_diag_gsd`.

## What diag_int and wind_int actually gate

`diag_int=15` and `wind_int=5` do **not** gate GSD severe-weather maxima.
They gate `phys/module_diag_cl.F::clwrf_output_calc`, called under
`output_diagnostics=1` in `module_diagnostics_driver.F:1095`.
The climate-statistics module tests these periods at lines 171 and 292.
The GPU port carries all 48 produced fields: min/max, their times, mean and
population standard deviation for T2, Q2, SKINTEMP, SWRAD and SWNORM;
U10/V10 at the speed maximum, speed maximum and its time, and U10/V10/speed
means and standard deviations; RAINCV/RAINNCV flux maxima, their times,
means and standard deviations. Names follow the Registry (for example
T2MIN, TT2MIN, SWRADMEAN and TRAINNCVMAX). Times are forecast minutes.

RunConfig/import/export retain WRF's `output_diagnostics`, `diag_int` and
`wind_int`, with Registry defaults 0, 15 and 5. Both packaged recipe copies
enable the output. The default-off checkpoint echo omits these defaults;
prepared-cache identity treats them as default-tolerant output controls.

The port retains REAL MOD tolerance, INT(period/dt) counters, strict extrema
ties, reset timestamps left untouched by the source, and its speed-maximum
U/V reset quirk. Means/std slots hold raw sums until the closing step,
then the routine divides them in place; history does not finalize or reset
them. All 48 fields and both counters survive restart and tile transport.
ArWen checkpoint continuation restores the absolute forecast clock and window
arrays. The replay API also exposes the native restart flag and restart-relative
clock; native WRF restart-file interchange is not claimed.

`tools/climate_output_oracle/run.py` compiles the entire unmodified pinned
module with gfortran and framework-only stubs. Its frozen 106-call receipt
covers every field at every call, both cadences, changing/nondivisible dt,
native restart suppression and untouched reset values. Strict-numerics GPU
results match all binary32 words. Fast production numerics retain FMA.
Tests also cover real-step trajectory inertness, asynchronous Rust history
snapshots, restart restore, and pinned host gather/update/scatter with tile reuse.

## Initial-time reflectivity

With `gsd_diagnostics=1`, `do_radar_ref=true` and Thompson microphysics
8/28, the first history frame calls the fork's
`module_diag_gsd.F:17-153::gsd_refl_first_time_step` on the GPU. Before
`calc_refl10cm`, nonpositive rain number with rain mass at least 1.e-12
uses the native Marshall-Palmer intercept of 8.e6 m-4. This fallback is
private to the radar calculation; prognostic NR and all other inputs stay
unchanged. The first-call flag disables melting-layer bright-band treatment,
and the output retains the native -35 dBZ floor. Later history frames still
consume the microphysics-time diagnostic.

The history route supports resident arrays, host arrays and store-direct
domains through bounded 64-row GPU slabs. It prepares theta, Exner and
moist density with the fork's initial phy_prep expressions. Exact mode uses
this helper for the HRRR configuration too; stock exact-mode t=0 zeros
remain for configurations without GSD. Its 87-byte-per-level/thread arena
is bounded to threads in flight and included in preflight pricing and
kernel prewarm. The launched helper reads zero local-frame bytes on
RTX 3080 / sm_86 / NVRTC 13.0.48.

`tools/gsd_initial_reflectivity_oracle/run.py` compiles the unmodified
extracted Fortran helper and `calc_refl10cm`, plus the complete native radar
module, using desktop WSL gfortran. Only framework stubs and a harness are
added. The 16-call reference covers both selectors, supplied rain numbers,
fallback thresholds, warm/cold/mixed columns and native state preparation.
Strict-numerics GPU results match all 3,456 binary32 output words. Tests also
write native reference values through the Rust NetCDF history path for all
three placements. Fast production numerics retain FMA; word identity is
claimed with strict numerics on these fixtures. The desktop fast-mode probe
differs in 50 of 3,456 words, with maximum absolute error 1.90735e-5 dBZ.

## Evidence and qualification limits

`tools/gsd_output_oracle/extract.py` extracts the unmodified Thompson hail
expressions, scalarizing array indices only. Frozen gfortran outputs and
binary64 bin words are under `tests/data/oracles/gsd_output`. Seven hail
probes match float32 output words exactly. Other tests use manufactured
columns, metric helicity, reset boundaries, restart and real GPU model steps;
they do not establish full operational WRF forecast or complete-file parity.
The output kernels join preflight memory pricing and the parallel static
compile plan. The output-window entries and launched initial-history helper
measured zero local frame through the production loaders on RTX 3080 /
sm_86 / NVRTC 13.0.48; the recording names that platform rather than claiming
measurements on other architectures. The initial-helper unit also compiles
an unused older Thompson entry from its device header; that entry is never
launched here and is excluded from the zero-frame claim.

The separate `diag_print=1` DPSDT/DMUDT console-budget path has no history
flag in Registry.EM_COMMON:1922-1923 and is not implemented here. The
restart-only 3-D `rlv`/`rlvn` extrema are not emitted history variables and
are not native restart interchange carriers. The Registry also declares
NCI/NCA convection-initiation counters and QR_MAX_CI/QG_MAX_CI, but the pinned
GSD producer does not update them. This lane does not invent values for them.
GSD hail tables for microphysics other than 0/8/28 are explicitly refused.

A full native output-file comparison remains outside the focused evidence.
The precipitation block's
additional runoff resets and ACSNOW/ACGRAUP/ACFRAIN accounting are not claimed
as part of the eight interval buckets; their physical land-surface carriers
need a separate units/ownership audit before being changed.

## Full-grid history cost

The resolved 1799 x 1059 x 50 recipe has 369 planned history fields and
**19,227,482,528 bytes (17.907 GiB)** per uncompressed full frame, including
the planner's bounded header allowance. At 48 hours, 103 frames total
1.801 TiB, compared with 49 hourly frames (before any data-dependent
compression). This is an inventory calculation; it allocates no full grid.

`gpuwm/io/wrfout.py::AsyncDomainWrfoutWriter` already has a side CUDA stream,
pinned D2H buffers, a worker thread and the Rust NetCDF writer. The worker
waits for D2H and performs file output off the stepping thread. However,
snapshot capture has a producer-stream event dependency, the bounded queue
can apply backpressure, and borrowed host-store frames must be drained
before their arrays are mutated. Therefore **fully off-step-path, full-CONUS
throughput is not established** by this lane. The RTX 3080 cannot hold this
resident domain plus snapshots. A larger-card / streamed full-grid timing
receipt is needed to qualify sustained 15-minute output; no such run was
performed on the desktop.
